It was an easy 3 minute walk and be on your way to anywhere in NY. \r\nThe shower is something else, the best water pressure I have experienced in a long time.\r\nI thought the decor was cool and eclectic, Greta must have an artistic streak. The Murphy bed was comfortable, and the AC unit (not pictured) kept it nice and cool.  \r\nAlthough I didn't meet her, she arranged for a neighbor to meet me and show me in. He was cool and so were any other neighbors that I met. \r\nShe also left a list of suggestions where to shop and eat, along with menus which was helpful when I needed a late night meal. \r\nHighly recommended. \r\n"

Plus, the beds are quite comfortable. My daughter exclaimed \u201cHey Dad, come lie down in this one. You\u2019ll never want to get up!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood was incredibly well located and enjoyable. The train stops  a half block away, and there are numerous excellent restaurants and conveniences close by. Greta, the host, provides a first-rate list of recommendations.\r\n\r\nGreta was a personable, helpful and extremely welcoming host.

The Murphy (fold-down) bed has a very thick memory foam mattress that is extremely comfortable.  Samantha (the cat) was a sweet little presence, but she kept mostly to herself so we barely saw her.  The location is great, less than a block to the 1 line, and there are several nice restaurants in the neighborhood.  Finally, Greta herself was a perfect host:  kind but not intrusive, thoughtful in her preparations for guests, and available should any problems arise (though none did).  A great airbnb experience!"

I requested her a really early check in and she agreed (which was helpful because I took a red eye from Seattle). She also allowed me to keep my bags after my check out time so I could pick it up before my flight.\r\nSecond - her apartment location is SUPER convenient. Right next to the #1 and pretty close to B and C lines. NYC is all about location is this fits perfectly.\r\nThird - her apartment gives the feel of a typical NYC apartment. It is tiny but has everything you need. Two beds, a great shower, clean towels, and a kitchen (which I didn't use). Safe building with elevator. \r\n\r\nI would totally stay here again.  "

Her apt is located close to all amenities, Central and Riverside Parks, and bus/subway stops. The apt is clean, more spacious than expected, well stocked with anything you could possibly need, and has very comfortable beds and a first rate shower. I was travelling with my soon-to-be 17 year old daughter so she was thrilled to have her own bedroom! This is not fancy accommodation but warm and homey and probably a good representation of how an average New Yorker lives, although I suspect not many are as organized as Greta. Much recommended!"

There is also a CVS , Walgreens, grocery and liquor store within walking distance as well. The apartment is very clean and the bed is very comfortable. Checking in and out as easy as Greta is very flexible. The apartment is very spacious with a nice kitchen and lots of room in the fridge. I hope to continue to stay here every time I visit New York!

The subway entrance close to the apartment was manned and easy to buy and top up your pass, it is the only way to travel around the city. On leaving for the airport, after both our stays we had only to wait a minute on the corner with our luggage to get a taxi to the airport. Once again Greta allowed us to arrive and leave at times that suited us with our luggage which didn't leave us stranded for hours with difficult flight times from Australia which was a great relief, thanks so much Greta!"

We took Lyft around due to my mom's use of a wheelchair in the streets. Drivers made good time to and from lower Manhattan via larger roads. Elevator made it easy to get to and from the 4th floor apartment, and being on the 4th floor removed us from the street a bit. "

However, the location itself appeared to be great: the neighborhood around was magnificent, a very vibrant area, with extremely cheap and nice restaurants, street food vendors, shops etc everywhere. And actually, not touristic at all, you are going to see how local people live around there. Especially Mong Kok, which is just a little bit south, I really enjoyed walking around in the evenings. There are plenty of bus stops around, and the subway is at most 5 minutes away.\n\nThe place was also very nice. It was nice to see how common houses there look like and live there. Do not expect high luxuries or something, it is just a normal house. For me, it was a very nice place and adequately clean. There is also kitchen but I did not use it; there is tons of great and cheap food around, so there was no reason to spend time cooking (but Vicky one cooked and shared)! In general, I did not experience any negative issue regarding the facilities of the house.\n\nVicky provides with a sim card with unlimited internet, so it is even better than just having wifi in the house, as you can have internet in your smartphone or laptop everywhere you go. This helped navigating around the city a lot.\n\nVicky and her flatmate, J., were really nice and friendly. Initially, Vicky gave exact and clear instructions on how to get there. Both gave quite many suggestions on what to do in the city, and I even spent time with them. Both seem very interested in interacting with the guests, as long as they have time, of course. \n\nOverall, I am really enjoyed my stay there. I enjoyed being in that location and walking around. Everything concerning the house was working fine, making my stay in Hong Kong comfortable. Also I am very happy to have met Vicky and J., and enjoyed our interactions. I would certainly recommend."

Didn't meet her but we managed to communicate through messenger and she explained everything well. I had no problems checking into her home on my own. Just be sure to take the odd numbered elevator and remember the building door gate is closed after 10pm. Also, the night bus to the airport is a short walk away on Nathan Road!"

She also let me check-in earlier than the listed time since my flight arrived early.\n\nAs for the place, what you get is a simple, cozy room that\u2019s perfect for solo travelers. It is spacious enough to have room for luggage and there is a desk where I was able to comfortably work. The room has very good air conditioning that keeps the room cool despite the hot and humid weather in Hong Kong.\n\nIt is very close to MTR and bus stations so it\u2019s easy to get around if you feel like exploring. There are also shops and convenience stores nearby if you ever decide to grab a quick snack.\n\nI had a very pleasant stay at Yi\u2019s place during the 3 nights I spent in Hong Kong."

I was not able to sleep when I was there because it was cold, and the bed blanket was very thin.  I could also hear everything going on in the living room . The neighborhood was depressing. Several people warned me about walking alone in the area late at night. I ended up spending a lot of time and money looking for an alternative place after I arrived in Hong Kong. It was close to New Year's Eve, so I had to return to this place for the last nights of my stay as I could not find an affordable hotel room. I cannot recommend this place."

The apartment is very quiet for the area. Although I never met Yi in person she was always accessible to communicate. The room was very sparse but functional wifi was good.\n\nThe place has 3 bedrooms, a common living room with a table, a Chinese style kitchen and a very tiny showering area with hot water which is typical of Hong Kong apartments. There is a functional  TV. The price  is fantastic, cannot be matched.\n\nNow the not so good. The place is the most dirty place I have ever stayed at in HK, and at one point I lived for many years in HK. Yi mentioned the cleaning fee was for the bedrooms only and also no towel is included, which I believe she listed but I did not notice.  The place is good for backpackers and undergraduates. The entire week I was there 4 to 5 men and women stayed there and I can state the bathroom was never cleaned. The kitchen looks like a tornado hit it, and some of the grime is that thick amber tacky stuff from years of grease buildup. The living room is a thick dusty mess, the sheet covering the couch reeks. I had no idea someone, an airline stewardess who I never saw, had her personal things there and in fact the apartment was her home.  I borrowed a mirror left out on the table, and ate some crackers that I mistakenly thought were left by previous guests and it caused huge problems but I immediately returned the mirror and replaced the crackers.\n\nAll in all a mixed experience. I am sure others saw what I saw, but did not mention the messy aspect in their reviews. I am not being picky, but I wish I had know before I booked what I would actually encounter.\n\n Still it is a good deal, best walked into with your eyes wide open and a high tolerance for filthy common areas."

The\u00a0room that I booked has windows and is equipped with strong\u00a0aircon. Overall, I enjoyed my stay in this apartment. This is a very good area to experience local Hong Kong life where one can see elderly folks, mummies with children, blue collar workers, and of course office workers mingling with each other. Though this area in Sham Shui Po is not posh, its down to earth vibes makes this place very real.\u00a0"

A esta\u00e7\u00e3o de metr\u00f4 tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 perto e tem v\u00e1rias op\u00e7\u00f5es de alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o muito pr\u00f3ximas \u00e0 casa. O layout da casa assemelha-se \u00e0 um hostel, o quarto que eu fiquei tem tamanho excelente para 4 pessoas e tem ar condicionado, o que faz muita diferen\u00e7a com o calor que est\u00e1 no Rio de Janeiro. Existem 4 banheiros, que s\u00e3o suficientes para o n\u00famero de pessoas que cabem na casa, entretanto durante todos os dias que passei l\u00e1, o banheiro n\u00e3o foi limpo nenhuma vez, por sorte os h\u00f3spedes estavam mantendo-o em condi\u00e7\u00f5es de uso, mas seria importante limpar o banheiro de vez em quando. \r\nOutro ponto importante \u00e9 que os quartos s\u00e3o ligados por uma porta que n\u00e3o tem fechadura e \u00e9 bem fina, ou seja, a privacidade n\u00e3o \u00e9 garantida e o barulho de um quarto pode ser ouvido perfeitamente no outro.\r\nO pre\u00e7o \u00e9 justo pelo que \u00e9 oferecido, seria importante apenas melhorar a limpeza e verificar se \u00e9 poss\u00edvel fechar a comunica\u00e7\u00e3o dos quartos."

The flat was as described, neat and tidy. The weather was quite cold, but thankfully A&G left us with extra blankets and electric heaters to use. Location was great. Outside the flat there was a slight smell of the river/ sewage, but in all honesty it did not come into the flat, and once you go down the road it doesn't carry on. This may also have been down to the very wet weather we had while there. All in all, very happy and would definitely recommend."

Das Apartment ist charmant, die M\u00f6bel schon etwas mitgenommen, aber das passt insgesamt ins Bild von Porto und macht den Reiz aus. Die Lage ist super, genau am Duoro. Es gibt Strassenmusik bis in den sp\u00e4ten Abend und auch morgens geht's fr\u00fch los mit fr\u00f6hlichen L\u00e4rm von der Flusspromenade. Nichts also f\u00fcr Leute, die es ruhig brauchen! Die Lage ist wirklich exklusiv und tr\u00f6stet \u00fcber den recht teuren Mietpreis. Im Umfeld gibt es typische Touri-Fallen, wo alles doppelt kostet, aber gleichzeitig findet man auch sehr nette kleine Bars, in der man chillig und g\u00fcnstig fr\u00fchst\u00fccken oder generell lecker essen kann. Die Stadt ist klein genug, um sich schnell zurechtzufinden und gro\u00df genug, um immer wieder neues zu entdecken. Wir waren zu dritt (50, 25, 20 Jahre) und haben die Zeit wirklich genossen. "

There is NO HEATING in any of the rooms and living room, only bed covers (not nordic duvet) and small heaters which you have to switch off during the night. Those were not enough during our stay in January even we had sunny days! Moreover we were 5 people in the house without NO HOT WATER enough for all of us. \nThe pictures did not show the reality. Furniture was much older and WiFi signal is only available in the living room, not the rooms.\nOn the other hand, location is great if you want to stay close to the river. Although think about that all restaurants, bars and main tourist attractions are close to Train Station and Clerigos Tower which means 15-20 min uphill walking distance from the house."

But in warmer months Im sure this isn't an issue.\nThe beds are a little hard with one slightly out of shape,  and the shower is fairly basic (hand held) but does the job. Because of the central location some noise can be expected early in the mornings. \nOverall the apartment suited our needs for our short stay and the price is more than reasonable for what we got."

The house was perfectly clean and the easily able to accommodate 6 people despite only having one bathroom. The beds and living room were comfortable. \n\nHowever, we always felt somewhat on edge in the house due to the number of signs posted around the kitchen, bedrooms and bathroom about being charged 15\u20ac for all sorts of extras like not washing up or using extra towels and bed linen. Not that this would be particularly unreasonable but it made us feel like we were walking on egg shells in and around the house. \n\nThe hosts were aware that we were a group of six yet one of the beds was not prepared and we ran out of toilet paper well before we were due to check out despite only being there 2 nights. It really wasn't the end of the world but the shower head does not have a wall fitting meaning you had to hold it yourself if you wanted to stand underneath it."

Even though we booked our room through Airbnb, we were welcome to all the amenities the hotel had to offer.  We were pleased from our arrival at the hotel, where the exterior was as pretty as the interior and greeted by Robert whose very pleasant demeanor was refreshing.  Each of the staff at the hotel were very professional and accommodating but Robert stood out from the rest.  I was unfortunate enough to have left my phone at a nearby shop after returning via the hotel shuttle, when notifying the front desk to see if I had left my phone in the back seat, Robert quickly responded with his assistance in searching for the item, then driving us immediately to the last location while he assured us he would be outside waiting so we would not have to walk back. I did in fact find my phone at that location (thanks to a good Samaritan) and Robert refused to take compensation for his kindness.  The only thing I would do differently on our next stay is to spend the extra for the room with the patio, as the view from the hotel is quite nice and the breezes up there were wonderful.  We not only will be back to visit the lovely hotel but will gladly recommend it to all who might be vising the Greenpoint area. "

Indeed, because of a flight schedule change, I asked the Airbnb host and the welcome desk of the hotel how I could manage my last night cancellation to be refund. I did exactly what they asked me to do and have been informed two days after that they refused my request of refunding... Despite the policy rules, I found it very dishonest and not correct at all as I have asked them before doing the cancellation on Airbnb and the flight confirmation.\nMoreover, I felt insulted when they made me left the welcome desk to go to the basement in order to let other clients of the hotel believe everything is perfect (I was calm and just trying to solve the issue).\nSo to conclude, the room ok but bad experience in this Airbnb that is an hotel!"

          "comments": "This is everything we expected and hoped for in a sub-$100/night condo stay in Waikiki. This definitely isn't the Ritz, and if you're looking for a luxury get-away, you're barking up the wrong tree. However, if you're like we were: first time visitors on a budget with humble taste, then this place is perfect. The location is a tiny bit removed from the touristy Beachwalk shopping area, but not so far as to preclude you from limbering up for a spirited walk over there. And by the marina, you're actually quite close to the Ala Moana mall. So, the location is good. The place itself is a modest studio setup, but perfectly adequate with a good sized bed for a couple, enough space for your luggage, and a kitchenette and bathroom that though tight, is perfectly fine. There's also cable and internet if you're looking for homey creature comforts. It was also fantastic to have a free parking space included, an air conditioning wall unit, and the panoramic window view was pretty cool, though you only really get a peak of the beach. Also, David was very good about staying in contact with us the day we arrived to get acclimated, and we did not have further occasion to require his services the rest of our stay, so our contact was minimal, but satisfactory ... no problem there. The minor quibbles we had were pretty thin walls, so we would often hear the murmur of the neighbors' TVs. Also, there seemed to be two elevators working the entire building, so they could take quite a while to pop up. Again though, if you're like us, your #1 priorities are spend a minimal amount of time in your room, get out to experience Hawaii, come back to a sanitary place to sleep at night, all while staying within a reasonable budget. This place fit the bill, and we would recommend it to anyone with the same priorities."

It's definitely not luxurious but has the basics and is in a great location. It fits 2 people but more would be cramped. \nYou can hit the beach in as little as 5 mns walking or get to central Waikiki beach in 15-20 mns walking.  It's also easy to catch a bus to visit something outside Waikiki. There is a convenience store nearby, as well as several breakfast and restaurant options. The apartment has a small kitchen with cooking utensils but we ended up mostly eating dinners out. \nDavid was courteous and likely very knowledgeable about the area but we didn't ask him for suggestions, we ended up just using our guide book. \nOverall if you want to experience Waikiki without spending a fortune or being pampered, this is a great option. Mahalo David!"

          "comments": "Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The condo is in a great location if you want to be in or near Waikiki and Ala Moana. It's a small studio, and not luxurious, but great if you want a functional, reasonably comfortable and very affordable base for exploring Oahu. The parking space is wonderful if you rent a car, as otherwise you're looking at an additional $15-$20 a day. The building is right on Ala Moana Blvd so it's noisy if you keep the windows open, but that's also true of many high-price Waikiki hotel rooms. Air conditioning is a bit noisy; I slept with earplugs but my boyfriend didn't need them (I'm a light sleeper and use them at home). The condo has a full size fridge, small cooktop, microwave, coffee maker, coffee press, beach chairs, some knackered beach mats, towels, pots, plates, etc.. Wifi is a plus. The bathroom appears quite recently updated, and though small is nice - great shower. \r\n\r\nCons: There's no lanai and the view is very partial, but to us those were small things. Elevators were sometimes very slow and occasionally out of commission, which was a hassle and a bit concerning.\r\n\r\nWe never actually met David. All was handled by text and email. He instructed us to get someone to let us in to the building, which seemed a bit dodgy, but in the end it was no problem, and he said to call if there was any issue. Condo door was unlocked and keys were on the table.\r\n\r\nI would consider staying here again if I plan to stay in the Waikiki vicinity. \r\n\r\n"

It's close to Waikiki and the downtown area but not in the thick of things so if you're looking to avoid the 24/7 hustle and bustle then this might work for you. There is a basic kitchenette and eating area. Accessories for enjoying the sand and surf are available for use, pool, and hot tub as well, and secure parking which is a plus.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for expansive ocean views, a room to hang out and relax in with up to date decor, and where you can easily meet and get to know people staying in the complex then this wouldn't be for you. The dependability of the elevators, particularly during high winds, is a bit of a concern.\r\n\r\nI never met David, things were handled via airbnb email. I spoke with him on the phone when my plans changed and he was flexible in changing the dates of the original reservation.\r\n"

Access was incredibly easy as he left the keys in a lock box near the private parking.  Unit was clean, great views of the marina and in the heart of Waikiki.  All of this for under $110/night, I couldn't have asked for more.  If ever back in Oahu, I'll be sure to reach out to David again."

The unit was as described with all the basic amenities one would need. I couldn't have asked for a better location as you could easily walk to the mall and the park as well as catch the bus for getting around the island.

The elevators are a bit slow and one of them was always down for service, but that's no fault of Davids, just a warning if you are in impatient person.  If you are looking for an affordable place in a very good location check this place out.  "

As a former 5-year resident of Honolulu I can attest that this building is conveniently located at the entrance of Waikiki close to the Ala Moana Shopping Center and Ala Moana Beach.  This was my very first experience ever using Airbnb so I didn't really know what to expect.  I travel to Honolulu 4 times a year and always stay in a hotel, but my cousin recommended I try Airbnb as a less expensive alternative.  I had some technical issues when I first checked into the studio getting the window A/C unit (A/C remote I believe had dead batteries) and cable TV to work (T/V HDMI input wrong) but with David conveniently living in the building, he was quick to remedy the situation.

Parking is difficult to come by in Waikiki and when available will run you at least $25 a day so this condo is a bargain.  Lockbox made for easy check-in/check-out.  Elevators in this tower are iffy but at least one of the two elevators was working during our stay so not a problem.

We got lucky with the elevators (unlike most reviews) as both elevators were operating during most part of our stay. \n\nWe had a bathroom crisis in the middle of the night when the flushing tank overflowed and almost flooded. Luckily David took care of it right away in the morning and even cleaned up the affected. \n\n"

Spent 9 days on Oahu to attend a conference and visit family. If you're looking for a no frills, small but clean place to stay where you can save a few $$ by cooking and warming local meals easily in the mini kitchen and walking to the Hilton Hawaiian Village (.8 mi.) this is the place for you. Elevator was a bit slow so if you have to be somewhere on time you'll need to allow maybe 10-15 additional min. A/C worked but slow upon startup but who cares if you're enjoying the outdoors and rarely in the room? Ran into David in the lobby just before checking out--he is kind and lovely!

The one working elevator was broken half the time and incredibly slow the other half. Instead of waiting 30+ minutes (not exaggerating), we went up and down 16 flights of stairs. I felt awful for those on higher floors.\r\n\r\nThis is certainly not David's fault, but I hope it is fixed soon. It's ridiculous."

The apartment is good size for two people and very clean, the linens are of good quality and ample, and the kitchen is well equipped.  Of note are the windows which span 18 feet to provide good natural lighting, a partial view of the marina and ocean front, and good ventilation (we never used the A/C).  We were impressed with the location \u2013 walking distance to the hotel beaches, the Fort Derussy military facilities, Ala Moana Park and Shopping Mall, public transportation, restaurants, and convenience stores.  The elevator service for the 40 story/140 unit building  is an ongoing problem, with only one ten-person lift  operating \u201cin slow mode for  safety\u201d or not at all if winds are high.  You'll certainly need patience when gaining access to the apartment and possibly physical endurance to negotiate the stairs (we only had to climb the stairs 3 times in 2 weeks)."

          "comments": "Location is very near the ocean, Waikiki, Ala Moana the largest shopping mall in Hawaii, is just a five-minute drive away giving you easy access to over 340 shops, services and entertainment. The mall is just down the street or you could walk there, free parking at the mall if you do drive. Down the street on Kalakaua is Luxury Row. The world\u2019s top fashion houses\u2014Tiffany & Co., Coach, Yves Saint Laurent, Chanel, Gucci, Tod\u2019s, Bottega Veneta and Hugo Boss it was fun to go in the shops. Having a free parking space is a bonus. The view of the marina and ocean was beautiful. I could see boats headed out to sea and parasailers. Laundry located on the 5th floor along with the ice machine if you're headed out for the day a small cooler was provided. Vending machines are on the 2nd floor or you can walk to the ABC store at the corner. Bed was soft and comfortable. Air-conditioner works perfectly or you can open the window for an ocean breeze. Great pressure in the shower and plenty of towels. If you want to eat in there is a microwave, stove and fridge. During busy times you may have to wait for the elevator, only 1 is working, but there are stairs."

Appliances were dirty so we did not use them and the sponge in the kitchen had hairs stuck on it. There was also hair on the floor and restroom. I feel like with the $75 cleaning fee, they needed to do a much better job. The TV had no reception so we weren\u2019t able to use it. The mattress was pretty hard to sleep on. Although we were aware of the elevator issues, the wait for the elevator took up to 15 mins at times.\n\nWas located in a very nice location, close to everything. You could walk everywhere. The host was very nice and contacted us before arrival and before leaving.\n\nOverall, if you\u2019re looking for a comfortable stay, I would suggest going to a hotel."

One of the elevators isn't working but the one that is will be fast enough (usually a few minutes at most), you're on island time now after all. Lots of clean towels which is highly appreciated!! Be sure to get malasadas from Leonard's Bakery, then snorkel Hanauma Bay and eventually get spicy shrimp at Ted's Bakery :D"

David responded usually within two hours.  We were disappointed with the rental but David worked with us to adjust the rental fees.\n\nThe biggest issue we saw was that the condo was dirty.  With a cleaning fee of $100 and the nice pictures on the Airbnb website, we expected a mostly dust free and clean rental.  We talked with David about the dirty items (there were many) and a couple missing items.  He was apologetic and did his best to help salvage our stay. \n\nWe ended up leaving before the end of the rental agreement and David worked with us on that.  After our stay, David messaged me to say that the items I told him were all addressed.  I would recommend that the next renter message David and verify.\n\nBecause of the location, the free parking, and David, I would rent the condo again."

We experienced a elevators failure during Christmas holidays, so no maintenance was available for few days. The apt is on the 16th floor so climbing the stairs (small ramps of 7 steps each though) at least twice a day was quite annoying. The host offered spontanusly 255\u20ac refund for the inconvenience."

I even walked to Leblon from there in under 40 minutes. \n\nThe hosts met me up front and helped me with my luggage. They don't speak English, but are very charming and helpful, so we communicated via (Hidden by Airbnb) Translate, using (Hidden by Airbnb) .\n\nThe building is slightly older. One day there was no water in the building due to maintenance. The hosts warned me about this, there was nothing they could do and I was prepared. Only issue is that after the water came back, because of the older pipes, it was brown for a little while, just have to let the taps run for several minutes. \n\nThe bed isn't the most comfortable for an extended stay (I was there for eight nights), but for short durations it's fine. \n\nThere is a washing machine in the apartment, it works great, I dried my clothes by hanging them on chairs, hooks, etc. \n\nThe WiFi is strong and reliable. \n\nThere is a grocery store and a couple of reasonably priced restaurants on the block, as well as two different banks. Excellent for visitors. A drug store is also available on the next block at the corner. \n\nOverall the inconveniences were small and the positives of this location was great. "

Su llavero ten\u00eda una tarjeta de descuento para el supermercado, ella nos lo prest\u00f3 y nos sirvi\u00f3 mucho para hacer las compras. Valeria fue de gran ayuda en todo momento.

A dos cuadras est\u00e1 el hotel Atlantis... donde compr\u00e9 3 tours a : Angra do Reis/Isla Grande, B\u00fazios y uno a Cabo do Reis... todos excelentes 200 reales por persona. Recomiendo un restaurante a 2 cuadras del depto de Valeria se llama Eclipse... ricas pizas a 12,5 reales... hamburguesas con papa a 18 reales... carnes con agregados(pica\u00f1a) a 33 reales... muy rico y buen precio.

Al\u00e9m disso, \u00e9 preciso destacar a localiza\u00e7\u00e3o, bem pr\u00f3xima \u00e0s praias de Copacabana e Ipanema, e de estar no mesmo quarteir\u00e3o de lanchonete, padaria, restaurante, supermercado, farm\u00e1cia e bancos!

If you\u2019re like me, and you love Rio, and go to the beach everyday, there is no better location. I can hop on a skateboard and get to Leme or leblon, no prob. \n\nI won\u2019t say more, so when I want to book again it will be available!!\n\nThank you Ana Valeria. Beij\u00e3o, amiga."

You can literally see the Subway platform from Josh's window. Also a couple steps away from anything you could possibly need... restaurants, juice bar, organic grocery, etc. "

The flat is light and spacious, kitchen well-equipped, bed comfortable (both beds actually), and bathroom clean, with great shower pressure. Zeynep prepared a note with key information about the flat, which was great to have for reference. I especially appreciated the ground coffee and coffee maker. The fact that there was a desk in the house made my stay all the more comfortable - I had a proper place to sit down at my computer.\r\n\r\nIt's clear that Zeynep has put a lot of care into making her flat a home - it's an awesome flat! \r\n\r\nZeynep lives a five min walk to the sea, with a great park along the water front. There are plenty of hip cafes and coffee shops in the neighborhood (Moda), all a short walk from the flat. And it's only a 15 mins walk to the Kadikoy ferry, which offers easy access to the rest of Istanbul."

From this place you can visit most monuments in the European side of Istanbul with the least complications (bus stop 1 min away and it serves Sishane metro in 10 min). If you take the bus to Sishane you can have 1 hour walk to most historical places in the European part. Next to his place there is a big market (both sides of a long street) with lots of local Turkish food. Just before his place, you can identify a small restaurant and a small grocery store. \n\nAli is such a great host with distinguished Turkish hospitality. He helped me several times to locate appropriate places for buying gifts. We had interesting discussions and his excellent English helped us had rich cultural exchanges. \n\nI'd recommend this place if you want to get a great value of your money and enjoy a true Turkish life experience (neighborhood and hosting)."

Non corrisponde alle foto, perch\u00e8 le stanze da letto sono molto pi\u00f9 piccole di quello che appaiono, piene di suppellettili polverose e in disordine. Il sofa bed \u00e8 praticamente un divano sporco dove abbiamo dovuto chiedere lenzuola e ci \u00e8 stato dato un solo lenzuolo. Il bagno \u00e8 una latrina minuscola tanto \u00e8 vero che non appare nelle foto pubblicate. Non abbiamo potuto dormire neanche una notte perch\u00e9 non c'\u00e8 neanche un cassetto o un armadio vuoto in cui poter stipare i propri effetti. Abbiamo pagato per tre notti oltre 800 euro, non abbiamo passato neanche venti minuti in quella casa, abbiamo dovuto trovare all'1 di notte un'altra sistemazione a New YorK - per cinque persone, compresi due bambini minori - e Chelsea non ci ha risarcito neanche un euro. Veramente un comportamento deprecabile da parte sua."

He was also very responsive to additional questions. The residence service at the counter was also good and the blokes were helpful. The apartment is clean and spacious, although it could do with a couple of extra basic necessities particularly in the kitchen. \r\n\r\nHowever, two main things made this experience rather average instead of great.\r\n- I reserved a flat with TWO bedrooms and only got one. I complained and they relocated me to a bigger apartment with two separate beds, but still ONE bedroom.  Upon booking make sure to confirm its two bedrooms you sign up to.\r\n\r\n- Saturday seemed to be national construction day which meant 8am rise and shine. sunday there was activity too although less loud. Normally not a problem but not great when you experienced some of the Istanbul night life the night before. A notice about this at least would have been great."

Fabio was very accommodating during check-in, even though we had arrived late in the evening, and took the time to explain the apartment and the city itself. The unit is an easy 5-minute walk from the Trindade Metro Station. There were plenty of bars and restaurants nearby, and two supermarkets within 5-minutes of walking (one was open on Sundays, which saved our lives). Though the apartment is located in a lively area, an extra set of shutters provides an additional layer of sound insulation which was a big plus! \r\nCons: The apartment did not have shampoo/conditioner during our stay. Neighbors could be loud at times. Very little sound insulation on the apartment unit door.\r\nOverall: My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Fabio's apartment building. If we are able to visit Porto again, we would definitely stay in this charming apartment again! Thank you, Fabio!"

Fabio really likes his hometown and took the time to show us on the map what to do and where to go. The little guidebook in French was very helpful when walking around! The apartment is just as described and just like it is on the photos:clean, functional, pretty and very well-located. It faces the street but it's not loud at night. You can walk anywhere from Fabio's flat. We had a lovely time and we were very happy in Porto :)"

He was waiting for us when we arrived, and then he told us everything important about the city, gave us information about the sights, how to reach them and so on. So he told us for example that we didn\u00b4t have to use public transportation, and that is absolutely true, because the apartment is so good located, that you can reach every important point by walk. But if you have to use the underground it is close to the flat, so get to the airport or the beach isn\u00b4t a problem. The flat is extremely clean, and furnished very modern, so it was a great feeling to stay here. Especially for those of you who like to party with the domestic, there are a lot of bars in the neighbourhood, which are full at night, so you can enjoy a walk at night there. I would always choose this apartment again and would recommend it to everyone. Thank you Fabio."

So, while the exterior of the building and hallways look a bit old and worn, the apart,ent itself is quite nice and comfortable.   There are numerous restaurants and bars to visit nearby.  There is also parking available just right up the street.  We liked this apartment and would definitely consider staying there again."

The apartment was spotlessly clean and the kitchen was well equipped with cooking utensils, coffee maker, kettle, stove, etc. there was even salt, pepper and oil. Much appreciated as my husband and I cooked breakfast every morning. We LOVED the location. We walked everywhere from the apartment. Minutes from the Sao Bento(?) train station and many other attractions. There was a supermarket and laundromat within a few blocks as well as a variety of different cafes and restaurants. The apartment has been completely and tastefully updated and is completely secure.  We had a wonderful five days in F\u00e1bio\u2019s apartment and would stay there again if back in Porto. "

He was very accommodating with check-in and check out times. \nOnly downside is that the apartment doesn't have wifi, so perhaps not ideal for business travellers or longer stays. "

I would definitely choose this as a place to stay again if I get a chance to return to Sydney."

The only very small negative we can say is the noisyness at night on the weekend BUT you can pop to the pharmacy next door and pick up some earplugs and that solves the problem!! Absolutely LOVED the location and decor of the apartment. Ben was so easy to communicate with and made sure that we were comfortable and had everything we needed :-) If you stay here, it is well worth looking at Ben's suggestions for top spots in the area. We went down the road to Bourke St Bakery everyday (amazing coffee and food!!) and went to the Italian restaurant Vacanza on our last night-simply delicious! We would 100% stay again on our next visit to Sydney :-)"

I let ben know and he didn't reply. I chased 2 days later and he agreed to come and take a look - afterwards the issue was much worse and the entire floor was covered in water, the shower then also wouldn't turn off. Ben told me he would look into a plumber coming and once again failed to get in touch - I chased and said it was uninhabitable like that .. and Ben then demanded that we leave that very day with no compromise with time to find somewhere else, despite us having 4 nights left and visiting from London. \nAwful experience all around."

Within about a 1.5 mile radius (35 min walk) we could really get to any part of town of interest, and anything else uber is always convenient. The place is small and cozy, nothing more you need for your stay. The TV is a smart TV with the youtube app which (we didnt realize till after staying in our other airbnb's without it) was awesome! \n\nThe only thing is, the bed and the couch kind of sunk in. So we ended up sleeping on the ground. Which honestly isnt bad at all, and made my back feel muuuch better the next day. Honestly didnt detract from the experience at all."

Not to mention the extras that I wont bother to take next time we stay like umbrellas, shopping bags, tea bags, band aids and spare blankets. Perhaps having  a hairdryer available would have lightened my luggage! \nCheck in and check out was easy. Ben was available ,approachable and very helpful. \nThe location was perfect for exploring Sydney. A 20 min stroll down historic Oxford St to Darling Harbour. Many different buses right out the front to Centre Point, Bondi, Circular Quay  just to mention a few. Don't forget to get your Opal card from any newsagent and you can top it up with cash on line! Walking distance to the train to explore further a field.\n The studio apartment on the 7th floor has spectacular views ( the photos don't lie!) and is nestled in a friendly community with many restaurants/cafes/shops/chemists all within walking distance. We will be back for many visits I am sure...thanks again Ben!"

Close to bus stops that'll take you to all of Sydney's major destinations as well as a 10 min walk from Central Station. Ben was a great host and was super easy to communicate with. Would love to stay here again in the future!"

          "comments": "Worst Airbnb experience ever! On arrival, the apartment was quite grubby and full of host's personal possessions with only 2 drawers left for the two of us over a fortnight. The fridge had half empty jars, food stains were all over the cabinet doors, and the place was dusty.\nWe had a disaster in that we accidentally left the keys in the apartment (that locks behind you!). We were unable to contact Ben for over 2 days as he had left the country without informing us - ending with us out on the street for hours, having to stay in a hostel overnight and eventually paying for a locksmith as we desperately needed our belongings. Ben was not even remotely apologetic once he finally got in contact with us. \nOnce we asked him if it was possible for him to reimburse for the locksmith and other costs, he replied aggressively with snarky and unnecessarily nasty comments about our stay - saying we had left wet towels on the floor when actually we had left one wet towel in the laundry basket that we had used to clean the water from the leaking toilet that was a great inconvenience throughout our stay and has been a complaint from another guest. Also said we raked through his personal belongings which were against his 'rules', when actually we only used a couple of towels from a drawer since he only left us one bath towel for two people for a fortnight. Ben has also attempted to charge us 100AUD regarding a small stain on the bed sheet, which is a completely ridiculous price especially considering the fee that we paid for cleaning.\nFurthermore, we asked where he would like his new keys to be left so he could get back in his apartment - to which eventually he said to 'leave them on the kitchen table'. This obviously doesn't make any sense and he only replied a few hours before our departure so we replied we would leave one of the keys in an envelope in his letterbox under his other mail. Only after we requested reimbursement days after we had left, he replied in a hostile manner that he had to pay for his own locksmith as we didn't leave him his key(?). \nOverall a dreadful experience that we wouldn't like anyone else to go through, as leaving the keys in an apartment when the door locks behind your back could essentially happen to anyone. This could have been handled far more efficiently & pleasantly if the host had actually been a decent person so BEWARE."

Bathroom was very dirty with a broken toilet seat that was never fixed ...eventhough the staff was politely reminded each of the seven nights we stayed...holiday or no holiday...how can you be running a place like that? AC wasnt functioning, however, it was fixed by the end of second night and a fan provided as a replacement. In the end, it was exceptional as a budget place. I would highly suggest that the management take cleaning and basic hygeine into serious consideration (mold on the bathroom wall) the place could earn a 4 star experience with ease. "

Since I was traveling alone, I was given a room enough for a single traveler. The room in the listing is probably the room beside mine. Anyway it is not a big deal. I would still definitely stay here in the future. Thanks Mehmet!"

I went with my boyfriend who had been to the city before, and my first visit was fantastic in the area of Mehmit's place. Can walk to everything. Good food and drinks right downstairs, and staff and friends of the Siva Restaurant are always available.  It's very lively at night, so it's a great place to stay if you're social and stay up late.  Mehmit's place is the whole package and experience.  Well worth it and a good price."

Rooms in the house were on separate ends making for more privacy. \nMy flight had been delayed multiple times, Vick was nice enough to allow my guest to check in without me. He and his sister, Maria were very fast in responding to our needs and even checking on us to make sure we were okay. \nDue to late flight departure, both Vick and Maria allowed later check out times to accommodate us. I would recommend this spot for small groups and I would love to stay here again! \nThanks so much! Trip successful! "

It's a big house with 10 large bedrooms, and common livingroom and large kitchen, deck (super nice) and bathrooms (3 bathroom area with individual shower (nice one), sink and toilet). I met nice people who gave me good advices to get around Sydney. David, the host, is very responsible and responded on the post to my emails while I was there. Being large, the house is very quiet and no one really bother anyone else. A cleaner shows up everyday, they were two ladies when I was there. They do an amazing job keeping the place spotless, and they are also very sweet. Now, Coggee is an amazing place. The house is up the street from the beach- there is also a large green park next to the beach. It's really nice. I went swimming at the ladies bath (sometype of sea water swimming pool on the beach) the first morning despite being Winter: amazing! I find that the picture showing Coggee beach do not make justice. It is so much more beautiful. I can't wait to go back there. (details: bus are down the street, Sydney downtown is 25min away, the airport is 20 min away (35$ for a cab), Bondi beach is 2 beaches away :p (20min), and peroquees are all around:)"

Es gibt einige Gaststaetten und kleine Superm\u00e4rkte in der N\u00e4he.\r\nDie Ausstattung des Appartements ist sehr gut - 1 Hauptbad und 1 kleines separates, komplette K\u00fcche, TV in Wohnzimmer und Schlafzimmer, etc. Es ist wie auf den Fotos bei Airbnb dargestellt.

It was in a perfect location right across from Hyde park. I did not use the pool but the apartment does have a roof top heated pool which looked great. Apartment was clean and the bed was comfy. Desire\u00e9 was a wonderful host and had some lovely touches such as stocking the fridge with beers and provided snacks, fruit and milk etc. the bathroom was also stocked with products and didn't even need to use my own shampoo etc. We also were allowed an early check in and a late check out which was just amazing. I will be staying here again on my next visit. "

Desire\u00e9 was exceptionally communicative and helpful, across arrival instructions and helpful hints, to being extremely flexible with my check in and departure times from the property. She was wonderfully generous with items left in the fridge for me to help myself to, and even some lovely fresh flowers for me on arrival. It's a gorgeous apartment right in the hub of the city BUT with the bedroom double glazed I had some of the best nights sleeps here I've had in ages. Terrific stay. Best part? Uber wide screen Tv and free NETFLIX! I loved this apartment. Don't hesitate to book."

She kept in contact with me to make sure everything was ok which was very thoughtful.  There was fresh roses in the apartment really lovely touch also lots of groceries like tea bags, coffee, milk etc. which was great after a long flight.  There are even bath robes and lovely fluffy towels The apartment is beautiful very luxurious, we loved it.  It's spotlessly clean, great TV, WIFI, everything you need and more. It's a great location. Very easy to walk around from and also Museum station is right on the door step. It was our first visit to Sydney and should we go back I would love to stay here again.  I can't thank Desiree enough. We were absolutely thrilled with it. Truly 5 star."

A perfectly stocked kitchen and tasty tea made it really homely. It was also spotless clean and the African styled furnishings gave it a memorable touch. The house has friendly reception staff and they were helpful with giving directions. The location is sublime as it overlooks Hyde Park which is really close to both parts of the city centre. We highly recommend the flat and would happily stay again in the future. Thanks!"

The hotel rooms get marked down for being dated in reviews on hotel sites, but this apartment certainly isn't.  It's centrally located: it has Darlinghurst's little strip of restaurants just around the corner, and central Sydney equally close in the other direction.  I was here for a week in March and it (unusually) rained every day, so the 60\" UHD Samsung smart TV with Netflix and Stan (Aussie streaming), as well as Apple TV, was particularly welcome, as was the small gym on the roof.  The pool was less useful, but would be great normally.  Desire\u00e9 is a very friendly host too.  Highly recommended."

It hosts beautiful city views, a quick 5 minute walk to Museum rail station, and a hop to great restaurants and nightlife. The apartment is tastefully decorated with art and books from adventurous travels; furnished and accessorized with absolutely everything that I could require, plus more. I was impressed at the Desire\u00e9's thoughtfulness in accommodating her guests needs. Such things as a kind welcome note. Petite chocolates, mini fresh milk packs in the fridge, expresso machine and every conceivable toiletry item one could need inside a bathroom cabinet. Discreetly rolled up extension cords so you never have to look for one to reach the wall socket to charge your digital devices. The bed was comfortable, where sprigs of fragrant lavender greeted us laid upon freshly rolled up towels. We loved our stay and highly recommend Desire\u00e9 as a host. She communicated well, was always polite and prompt with messaging all required information upon booking. There's no doubt why Desire\u00e9 has been voted as a super host. You will be delighted."

There is everything you could want close by, especially restaurants and public transport, the airport train is just a few meters away. The apartment has everything you could possibly need and more. Desiree's interest and love of people shines through in everything she does; she goes way beyond being a superhost.  Thank you Desiree for making our stay so special and we can't wait to come back, hopefully when the weather is a little kinder."

It is smartly decorated with comfortable furniture and lovely modern kitchen and bathroom.  There is a guest laundry in the building with coin operated machines and you can do a big wash and dry for $4 each.  The apartment is bright and airy and has a nice busy city outlook which we enjoyed.  You can certainly hear the buzz of the city around you but you are right in the CBD so that is to be expected and enjoyed.  The location is fantastic.  You can walk to just about everything in the city centre and trains and buses are only metres away if you want to get around more quickly or go further afield.  Very easy access from the airport by train into Museum station. The host, Desiree, was a pleasure to deal with, excellent communication all the way through.  This is a wonderful little home away from home putting you right into centre of the Sydney action."

The unit was close to grocery, public transport and amenities were as if I had lived there.

It feels super safe to walk in.\n\nThere are great grocery and restaurant options right here...and we were hooked on Greenhouse Coffee just a few blocks down to start our day. We enjoyed the Sydney Festival and walked to their events and free activities. \n\nThe home had lots of lovely touches and thoughtful additions in the bath, the kitchen and a nice collection of books and info."

Despite the location right near Hyde Park, it is very quiet and we were not bothered by any noise during our stay.

I came for the Sydney Film Festival, and the apartment was well located on Hyde Par, so I could walk to and from the venue. The studio was very comfortable and well stocked too - the little things such as tea, milk, spreads for breakfast etc were thoughtful. Picking up and dropping off the keys were a breeze and whilst I did not meet my host, she was very responsive and helpful. I can highly recommend this place for a city based jaunt. Thanks again Desiree"

The host had amazing and quick responses during my stay - great communication. The apartment has 2 balconies which allow loads of sunlight into the space when the curtains are pulled back. Great location for Ubers, Taxis, walks in the park. I stayed for business and I walked to the CBD within 15 minutes - easy. I will definitely stay again!"

Chocolate on the coffee table, cold water in the fridge, cereal on the shelf, and roses in the bedroom greeted us.  Nine floors up you can hear the street noise but the bedroom is surprisingly quiet.  The location is near the metro and walkable to the waterfront.  This home and its location were perfect for our 6 night stay.  Would happily return on our next trip to Sydney."

Great location for exploring Sydney,  buses and trains within 5 minutes, walking distance to circular quay. Street noise was remarkably low in the bedroom. The only shortcoming was the internet connection,  very spotty if more than one device was was connected.   We would definitely stay here upon our return to Darlinghurst."

They provided everything they claimed and also more.\r\nPudit was also very helpful.The puppy is really sweet. I'm not a dog person but it didn't bother me.Its really well trained for guests. Usually you won't even notice its in the house. \r\nI had to extend my stay but the place was already booked after me. Cheer helped me to find a nearby Airbnb proactively.Also Pudit offered his cart to carry my guitars. It was really sweet of them. They are really approachable people.\r\nThanks for making my stay comfortable guys!"

She had everything I needed in the room including clean towels, cold water, a fan, books, and anything else I might need. The best part about her apartment was Mason the pup, he's VERY sweet!

Cheer's dog was absolutely adorable. Above all, I appreciated the privacy I was able to have coupled with the hospitality. \n\nIf you're looking for a spot close to Manhattan, Cheer's place is a good choice. Cheer's spot is close to various subway and bus stops, making trips into the city very easy. There are also a variety of good restaurants in the area, as well as delicious street food. \n\nI would definitely recommend Cheer's place!"

Er is een waterkoker voor thee en koffie, een airco voor de warme New Yorkse zomernachten, maar ook ligt er een schaal vol lekkere snoepjes voor je klaar wat een leuke verrassing is. Cheer zorgt dat het je aan niets ontbreekt! De badkamer is altijd schoon en als je iets nodig hebt wil Cheer altijd helpen."

If you are a dog lover you will love Mason the french bulldog. He is super friendly and very well behaved. The location is perfect if you fly in and out of LGA. I highly recommend it if it is your first time visiting NYC. I would definitely book her place again for my next visit to NYC."

The place was very clean and Cheer provided many extra amenities in the room such as a small fridge, a water boiler, TV with cable/Netflix, candies and much more! The French bulldog is also very cute, well-behaved and quiet. It is only an easy couple blocks walk to the 7 subway train and there are also a lot of restaurants in the neighborhood. I wouldn't hesitate to stay at Cheer's place the next time I am in NYC, it really has everything you need. Thanks Cheer!"

But Cheer was very helpful and accepted me as a guest. If you choose to stay with them, you are looking at a cozy bedroom well-stocked with basics like an electric kettle, a tiny fridge, water, tea bags, instant coffee sachets, creamer and sugar. So, there was no need to intrude their kitchen. Once you step out, you are welcomed to a melting pot of cultures. There are many inexpensive but good restaurants. The room was well-lit and comfortable. They really respect your privacy as well. I would definitely recommend you to stay with thffem."

We never used public transport, apart from getting there and leaving Porto. \r\nThere was some noise in the mornings as an adjacent apartment was undergoing renovation, but I guess that's permanent.\r\nOther than that this place is good value for money.

In the are there were shops and bars to have breakfast and buy food. We have been welcomed by cristina's friend Silvia which was very kind and patient Even if We called her few Times because We couln't find the apartment! Thank You very much "

She was also very responsive to any questions and let us check-in early.  The flat was great, spacious with plenty of room for all five of us, and we really enjoyed being able to hang out in the living room with a glass of port on our last night! Also, being just around the corner from a metro stop, it made getting into the city center very quick. The only downside was that even with the small space heaters in each room, the flat did get very cold. Nevertheless, I would definitely recommend staying at Cristina's flat!"

Cos\u00ec ho cominciato a cercare tra gli host un appartamento nella citt\u00e0 di Porto che avesse le caratteristiche necessarie per questo viaggio vacanza per ospitare le 6 persone comodamente. \nOvviamente cercavo anche qualcosa di economico.\nAlla fine ho contattato Cristina in quanto la sua offerta era molto vantaggiosa sia economicamente sia per la capacit\u00e0 di spazio di cui avevo bisogno. \nL'appartamento si trova molto poco distante  dal centro della citt\u00e0 solo due fermate da Trinidate (centro nevralgico di tutte le metropolitane di Porto e per andare sia verso l'aeroporto che verso le stazioni ferroviarie), ma a pochi passi dalla fermata della metropolitana di Marques. \nL'appartamento si trova al quarto piano di un palazzo servito con ascensore.\nCon l'host ci siamo dati appuntamento alle 13.30 presso l'appartamento. \nQuindi mi ha fatto vedere l'appartamento e mi ha spiegato come funzionavano le cose della casa, il collegamento al wi fi e dove riporre le chiavi quando avrei dovuto lasciare l'abitazione, e se avevo bisogno di ulteriori informazioni. \nQuindi ci siamo salutati. \nL'appartamento corrispondeva a ci\u00f2 che avevo visto su Airbnb. Pulito, ordinato e tutto funzionante. Ci siamo trovati molto bene, come a casa.\nLo consiglio a chiunque. \n"

The location was a short walk from the metro and an easy taxi journey to the centre of town, so very well connected. The apartment had everything we needed for cooking, cleaning and relaxing and has restaurants, shops and so on near by. Porto is a beautiful city, with so much to do and Christina's apartment is a fantastic place to stay to experience it. "

Really huge for an in-city apartment.  Great kitchen, comfortable living room, and just a really cozy and nice apartment to come home to each day after exploring.  Two bathrooms - a rarity in Europe - and a lift in the building for hauling your bags up the stairs.  A little bit out of the tourist center, which in our view provided a more authentic experience.  Great place!"

De kamers waren heel erg schoon, net als de badkamers, en ook de keuken was voldoende voorzien. En vooral Anabela, de dame die je ontvangt, is gewoonweg fantastisch. Ze heeft ons van heel veel leuke tips voorzien, ook dingen om te doen met onze kinderen, en ze was altijd bereikbaar voor vragen ed. Dit appartement is zeker een aanrader!"

It\u00b4s perfectly furnished!\r\nIt was located in the typical familiarly and quiet neighbourhood, only 20 minutes walking to the city center and near a Subway station. Restaurants and shops are cheaper than city center ones.\r\n\r\nHe offered him to pick us from the airport and a guided tour as well.\r\n\r\nWe\u00b4ll come back for sure! \r\n\r\n\r\nLlegamos muy tarde por la noche y la asistente del anfitri\u00f3n nos ense\u00f1\u00f3 la casa, nos dio dulces t\u00edpicos y vino de Oporto. Vino con nosotros por el barrio para recomendarnos restaurantes y ense\u00f1arnos d\u00f3nde estaba el supermercado. \r\nEl apartamento estaba limpio, ordenado y perfectamente equipado. Ten\u00eda armarios vac\u00edos para poder dejar c\u00f3modamente las cosas. El sal\u00f3n es muy grande. \r\nEst\u00e1 a 20 minutos andando del centro de la ciudad y tiene una parada de metro cerca. El barrio es familiar y tranquilo. Nada peligroso. Los restaurantes y tiendas eran m\u00e1s baratos que los del centro.\r\n\r\nEl anfitri\u00f3n se ofreci\u00f3 a recogernos del aeropuerto y a hacernos un tour guiado por la ciudad.\r\nVolveremos!!\r\n"

Everything was clean and tidy. There was lots of space for my family of 4. Especially we enjoyed a big balcony. It's well furnished and equipped but it would be great to add a washing machine. TV has a great channels list in Portuguese and English. The apartment is located in a walking distance to the city centre, metro stations, grocery shops, bakeries and pharmacies. WiFi worked perfectly. The bath has a handle grip, it's perfect for elderly guests and young kids. There is a small lift in a building. Our experience was great and we highly recommend to stay in this apartment."

There is a great gastronomy, bar options and nightlife so you don\u00b4t really need to leave the area if you don\u00b4t want, but of course if you want to visit the rest of the city you can easily reach \"Zona Sul\" (where Ipanema, Copacabana, Leblon, Sugar Loaf and Christ the Redeemer are) by bus or by cab.",

Every time that I could come back to the apartment it was a safe haven with beautiful views, nice balconies for my cup of tea, clean, light, perfect bed, super nice deli style supermarket downstairs with good take away and cold beer. Aline is a great lovely host that really wants to make the best Rio time for you as a visitor.  I can really recommend the apartment, location, Rio and host Aline!\nThank you so much. I'll come back with my family."

      "neighborhood_overview": "Princeville is a development of some 500 acres on the north shore of Kauai, between the towns of Hanalei and Kilauea. What started as a coffee plantation in the mid-1800s is now the largest planned development on Kauai. Princeville is home to some of the finest resorts, golf courses and restaurants on the islands. Kauai\u2019s north shore is also where you\u2019ll find some of the most spectacular scenery in Hawaii. There are three main beaches in Princeville, which are Kenomene Beach, Kaweonui Beach and Puu Poa Beach. A wide reef along these beaches creates warm pockets for swimming and snorkeling in calm weather. Other area activities include tennis, golf, windsurfing, kayaking, fishing, sailing, helicopter tours and shopping. You can arrange for a private guided jungle hike, waterfall excursion or kayaking adventure. ",
      "notes": "The pool and hot tub are available for your use until 9 pm.  Sorry no pets or smoking.",
      "transit": "The Kauai Bus is just about one mile away at the shopping center.",

      "house_rules": "Here are a few things that may be helpful to your stay. Please do not leave fan or lights on when you are not in residence. As in all resorts, no towels on balcony railing but on chairs is fine. Also observe Hawaiian tradition of \"no shoes\" in house. No loud noise or music after 9pm.  Please rinse beach items off after use by patio shower. Please use rags under kitchen or bath sink to clean off Kauai red dirt (not bath or beach towels!). Do not take bath towels to the beach. AT&T phones get poor service here. WiFi available.  Queen's Bath is right across the street. It is a natural volcanic lava pool. Please observe the warning signs at the top of the path. Always keep an eye on the ocean and stay off wet rocks as that means waves have broken over them. Also the path can be slippery when wet.  The pool and hot tub are for your pleasure from 9am - 9pm.  Do not park overnight on the grass. It is against Princeville rules.  Please tell us if you have a concern. Often things can be easily ",

The not as good: If you want to prepare and eat food in your place it is quite small, and the bathroom sink serves double duty."

It was a beautiful room in a gorgeous house.  The house really is very impressive and worth a stay there just to see it.  It is literally less than a block away from the trailhead leading to Queen's bath, so it's in a great location.  It's less than 10 minutes drive to Hanalei and about 25 minutes from Ke'e State Park.\r\n\r\nThe room was clean and had all of the things we needed to cook what we wanted while we were there.  There is no air conditioning, but fans are provided.  During the summer months I can imagine the room we stayed in would be quite hot, but it was about perfect in early November.\r\n\r\nI would definitely recommend staying here, and we will be back at some point ourselves."

Coral's hot tub was also perfect after a full day of hiking. Coral was extremely helpful, accessible, and thoughtful-she provided macadamia nut candies and water in the place of fruit from her large garden because the fruit was not ripe yet. Overall, the great stay made it a great trip!   "

As I've been to the island many times it allowed me to do everything on the north shore that I wanted to do.  Perfect home base to explore the area from.  Thank you Coral and Ian for a wonderful stay.  Bed was comfortable, fan and trade winds made the nights comfortable, and the welcome basket was delicious and appreciated!"

We wanted to complete the Hanakapi'ai Falls hike on this short visit.\r\nCoral was very quick to respond and offered us accommodation. The hospitality was exceptional and Coral and Ian treated us like family in their home.  \r\nWe were especially grateful for all the amenities that came with this room.  The room had a full size refrigerator that allowed us to chill our water for the hike.  We had a large screen TV, wi-fi, microwave oven, toaster and dishes for use in the room.  In addition, we had access to a cooler to take beverages along with us to the beach, a sun umbrella, beach chairs and many other useful items! Coral also offered my wife an awesome walking stick for the hike to the falls.\r\nAfter the long hike, we came back and treated our sore muscles to the jacuzzi.  There is also a grill if you feel inclined to cook in the courtyard.  \r\nLast, parking was free, and there is direct access (across the street) to Queens Bath which is incredible in the summertime.  \r\n\r\nBe sure to also ask about where to sit back and watch the sunset from the cliff overlooking Queen's bath just a short 2 minute walk from the room.\r\n"

The location is superb. It is a quiet neighborhood but not far from the \"action\" in Hanalei. Their pool was so very refreshing to swim in after a day of being out and about on Kaua'i. There are several beautiful beaches close by! They have everything you need for a great day at the beach. There is only one draw back here. The wifi is very iffy and not available in the room."

Ian and Coral were very nice and gave us lots of privacy.  Loved having the pool to ourselves every evening.  When booking, I knew we would be close to Queen's Bath but didn't realize that we would be at such an awesome location for sunsets.  The neighborhood was very quiet in the evenings and this is probably the only place we have ever stayed in Kauai that we didn't get woken up by roosters.\r\n\r\nWe stayed in the Garden Room, which got pretty toasty in the evenings with the west sun coming in. This may not be the norm as it was pretty hot on the island the week we were there and it was probably partially our own fault because we were not comfortable sleeping with the door open (nothing to do with the hosts - just my personal comfort level)\r\n"

Comme le stationnement est pour seulement 8 autos, nous avions le loisir de profiter de tous ces endroits paradisiaques sans probl\u00e8me.\r\nLa chambre est exactement comme d\u00e9crit sur Airbnb. Le quartier est tranquille, superbe et riche. \r\nAvec le ventilateur, nous dormions tr\u00e8s bien sans avoir chaud. \r\nLa feuille de r\u00e8glements \u00e0 l\u2019arriv\u00e9e est \u00e0 lire absolument\u2026 Elle vous informera sur comment obtenir des rabais au Foodland et aussi pour vous encourager \u00e0 ne laisser tra\u00eener aucune nourriture afin de ne pas attirer les fourmis.\r\nLa piscine avec sa cascade est comme sur les photos\u2026 paradisiaque. \r\nCoral nous donne des fruits bien m\u00fbrs de son jardin chaque jour \u00e0 notre grand plaisir. \r\nOn s\u2019y sent accueilli comme si on faisait partie de la famille tout en ayant notre intimit\u00e9 et tranquillit\u00e9.

You get a little room with bath,  private entrance, separate from the main house,  although all share an open atrium with pool and hot tub.   They allowed us to wash clothes as needed.  They provided some beach equipment.  The only drawback is if you need WiFi, the one they have does not carry to the rooms.  The house location is outside of the 4G networks so communication with the outside is frustrating. While access to Queen's Bath is across the street,  it's a treacherous and muddy hike down the steep slopes without safety provisions.   One sprained ankle and badly scraped back...\nThis would be a lovely place for a winter vacation but is too  uncomfortable  with summer heat. My rating is lower due to the heat issues."

Right next door to Hanalei Bay with restaurants and grocery stores only a 5-10 minute drive away.\r\n\r\nThe accommodation had access to a wide range of amenities such as pool, hot tub, bbq, parking. We stayed in the Breezeway ground floor room and found the room to be spacious, clean and comfortable. The room also came equipped with a fridge and kitchenette, which was perfect for making light meals and pack lunches for hikes and day activities. Be sure to visit the Queen's Bath open lot which is only a 2 minute walk from the house and provides the most spectacular sunsets!\r\n\r\nOur host, Coral, was friendly and helpful. We will definitely be back to stay at Asia House next time we are in Kauai."

Also it is really close to St regis resort (2min drive). I Highly recommend to go get a drink there and enjoy the beach.\r\nCoral and her family made us feel like home right away. They lent us surfboards and gave us tips on where to go hiking and finding good restaurants. It was really nice to meet everybody.\r\nWe'll be coming back :)"

Coral was welcoming when we arrived and was always available for questions during our stay.  We were so busy with the wedding and wish we had time to talk with her more.  We were often up early and out late.  The room had everything we needed and was spacious for the two of us.  It was wonderful that a cooler and beach chairs were available to borrow.  Ben and I highly recommend the place and would certainly stay here again if we visit Princeville again."

We loved waking up and coming home to such beautiful surroundings, with sounds of waves, birds, and frogs, and lovely gardens adding to the serenity.  The room and small \"kitchen\" area fulfilled all our needs for small meals at home, and we were generously offered the use of the grill and house kitchen if we felt inspired to do more.  On lazy days we enjoyed playing scrabble in the courtyard and watching the birds at the coconut feeder.  We loved being across the street from the trail to Queen's bath and had several wonderful sunsets there watching the sea turtles and the endangered shearwaters (our best guess) coming home to roost for the night in the cliff banks.   This was an amazingly good first experience with airbnb."

When we first arrived in the room we found a lovely bouquet of fresh tropical flowers cut from the grounds, including a gardenia, my favorite flower. The room was clean, quiet, comfortable and felt private. Even though the pool and hot tub are in a shared courtyard, whenever we wanted to use them we had them to ourselves. We totally enjoyed our stay in this beautiful location. Coral and Ian were very welcoming and hospitable, yet totally respected our privacy. I really enjoyed photographing the flowers and tropical plants with the gorgeous and unique home as a backdrop. The Queen's Bath was a short hike away and my daughter was thrilled to swim with some sea turtles there! We would definitely return."

The Garden room can get a little warm, but there is a portable fan in the room, and keeping the windows open helped! Coral and Ian really made us feel at home and are lovely hosts! A good deal for the price you pay in comparison to the luxury resorts in the same neighborhood. "

They also shared information about their lovely home, which really might be listed as a Japanese ryokan, and with the hot tub, even an onsen!  The comound (much more than a simple house) is fabulous, with a central courtyard with pool and fountain and designed and built by Ian in a traditional Asian (Japanese) style of architecture, with a delightful Hawai'ian garden with Japanese accents.  The room is comfortable, if un-air-conditioned (but with a fan, it was delightful and no AC noise!) and fully equipped with a full-size refrigerator and all amenities (coffee maker, toaster oven, microwave) on a table one can use to prepare breakfast or snacks.  Bathroom is large and comfortable.  Room has bookshelves full of information on Kaua'i and what to see and do.  Table in the garden is ideal for breakfast or cocktails in the shade after a hot day on the trail or in kayaks or on the beach.  We LOVE this place!"

When we saw Coral's ad on Airbnb we knew it would fit all of our wants and needs. Upon arriving, we were welcomed by her husband Ian who took us around their beautiful property. Location is a huge plus with this hidden gem, it is only steps away from Queen's bath and a short 5 minute ride from Hanalei, which we frequented. The pool was beautiful, even though we only used it once. Coral does a great job in making sure her guests are comfortable. Her hospitality is in a league of it's own from offering fresh fruit she grew herself to local insights on what to do and where to go. We stayed in Princeville just before their winter months. It was mostly on the windier side, but it did not inhibit our travels. The only one  recommendation we have is if you decide to take a boat tour to the Na Pali Coast to see the open-ceiling caves, go during the summer or when the swells are below 4ft. Whale season is just starting at the end of October, so keep that in mind too if you do decide to take a boat tour. Otherwise, here are our top 5 picks picks Kauai: 1. Kalalau Trail (bring shoes with traction!), 2. Ishihara Market for Poke (see Waimea Canyon same day), 3. Lawai Beach for Snorkeling (next to The Beach House), 4. Queen's Bath (sunny and low swells), 5. Kilauea Town (bakery, juice bar, lighthouse lookout). Enjoy your stay in Kauai! Mahalo! "

There are some great beach spots in walking distance and many more a short drive away. The room is located in a beautiful and distinctive home and Ian and Coral are warm and helpful hosts. Be aware it's one room with a fridge and appliances, washing up is in the bathroom sink so fine for breakfast but limits full meal production. We really appreciated other features like hot tub and pool and lovely plantings and architecture. Overall an excellent value and a memorable spot!"

Beautiful beaches all around you, great resort restaurants right there or beach towns with local fare. We also could make great breakfast at the room and then head out early to hike. Knowing we could come home to a great hot tub or quick dip in the pool was great too. \nThings stay moist here which I would highly recommend quick dry clothing.

The garden apartment was clean and had everything you needed. The hottub was nice to use after a day of hiking. Queens bath is right across the street and was beautiful to see. Coral was very sweet and accommodating and gave much privacy. Great place for a great price. Check out Happy Talk a mile away for a gorgeous view with cocktails. Princeville shopping center is a mile away which made it convenient for last minute things to buy. "

The Japanese-style gardens are a joy, and guests can enjoy use of the pool and outdoor spa (with quite powerful jets!) Only drawback for me was not being a motorist, which meant the premises were a bit isolated. But that shouldn't affect most, and there is good parking. And Coral and Ian were more than generous getting me to the village and access to Hanalei transport. Ian even treated me to a tour up to the Na Pali coast! Highly recommended."

The fan that Coral provides circulates the cool ocean air wonderfully.  I also appreciated that they allowed us to use their beach chairs, umbrella, and cooler.  All in all a wonderful stay!

Tourists note, most of the attractions advertised are on the south and west side of the island (closer to the airport) and beyond.  We took a couple day trips for the 2+ hour drive, and hit everything strategically so we weren't driving around the island every day.   Plan accordingly!"

There is a delightful interior courtyard with a small pool and hot tub available for guest use. The guest studio is compact with a kitchenette and a comfortable bed. The place is generally quiet, although you can hear other people in the residence, for instance when entertaining friends, although the volume was not too loud. Coral and Ian were very helpful and hospitable hosts, who were available to answer my questions and provide items I needed to care for a bee sting I got while at the beach. They were also generous in sharing fresh flowers, fruit and herbs from their bountiful gardens. I was curious about all the plants growing in their landscaping, and Ian was kind enough to give me with an educational tour of his gardens."

The garden house had the basics and everything we needed - private room, bath, fridge, kitchen utensils, etc + a great hot tub which was the perfect way to end our days. Coral and Ian were both incredibly nice and great hosts. We were mostly out and about across the island during the daytime. We did not have any issues and would absolutely recommend the room to anyone who wants a nice, calm place to call home for a few days on the north side."

They were very helpful in helping us find an open medical clinic on President\u2019s Day. also gave us access to more beach gear than was already available. The place is as advertised, with on-site access to a pool and a spa, right across Queen\u2019s Bath (good hike, but could be dangerous), in an especially magnificent neighbourhood, not far from shops and groceries. A very nice experience that we would repeat."

We walked to the very fancy St Regis for sunset drinks which was lovely, and the Queen's bath trail is right across the street! We loved our room and found it well appointed with everything we needed to make meals, relax in the hot tub, and rest after a long day of hiking and adventures. Coral and Ian are wonderful, and we would definitely stay here again. It's a perfect location and the house is a dream."

If you're not bothered by cleanliness issues, then you'll probably like this place a lot. \n\nAs far as location, Queen's Bath and Hideaways beach are both awesome destinations within walking distance (and both have parking challenges, so walking is a big advantage). Be aware that a lot of the most popular tourist destinations/activities are far away, especially with part of the North Shore currently closed. Waimea Canyon is two hours away; most tours like flying and ziplining are 45+ minutes. The nearby grocery store (Princeville Foodland) is the most expensive place on the island so stock up on groceries closer to the airport."

There were fresh fruits,  snacks, and water in the room when we arrived. And flowers and orchids everywhere. The host, Coral, and husband Ian are very friendly and gracious.  But they stay out of your way if you prefer privacy.  The grounds of this huge house are similar to an arboretum.  The en-suite bathroom and kitchen area are immaculate showing the care of a cleaner with very high standards. Look forward to returning if I can book far enough in advance to grab it."

The main ground looks like a beautiful botantical garden and the pool is such a beautifully designed lovely addition. Being right across from Queens Bath is also really neat! Corals husband also gave us some great tips about local gems to visit. There are a few different rooms available. My friend and I stayed in a more modest room but it had everything we needed and we were comfortable. We spent most of our time outside on the property or exploring the island so a simple room was perfect, especially on a budget.  It can be warm at night but the fan works well. I struggled a lot with the WiFi and had no cell phone service. I\u2019m sure Coral would have reset the WiFi if we asked but for me it wasn\u2019t necessary and I enjoyed being \u201cunplugged\u201d so to speak. My friend was able to get WiFi on her laptop, we just couldn\u2019t get it on our phones for something reason. Overall this was a wonderful vacation spot!! Definitely check out the St Regis for sunset cocktails and the beautiful town of Hanalei!"

It's very very nice.  The value I was getting increased 2-fold when we pulled into the location.  \n\nCoral got me an amazing deal on a rental car.  We do not require much, and our car wasn't much.  But, it had 4 tires, A/C, great gas mileage, and pick up from the airport.  If you just need a basic car, do not go to the rental places at the airport.  Talk to Coral.\n\nThe room was what we saw on the site.  It's clean, comfortable, and is set up for you to enjoy a quick, small meal at \"home\" when you want to save some money or enjoy your own cooking.  There is ground coffee and a machine which we used every day.  Refrigerator, plates, utensils, blender (Yes, I made Pina Coladas in our room), microwave and hot plate.  Everything you need.\n\n The rainy nights were an absolute joy.  Hearing the rain on the big leafy bush in the front window was relaxing and gave that extra atmosphere of being away and relaxed.\n\nThe grounds of Asia House are amazing and welcoming.  You will love your stay here.  \n\nMy only suggestion would be a ceiling fan.  The fan provided is adequate.  Our last day was the most humid.  My wife and just sat in front of the fan to get relief.  A ceiling fan would be amazing.  However, this does not change the fact that if we go back to Kauai, we are staying at Asia House.  It's a real gem.  I would not hesitate to recommend to anyone."

Surrounded by the quiet golf course, this neighborhood is an escape from the beaten path, but also a stone's throw (quite literally) to the famous Queen's Bath hiking trail. We stayed in the lovely garden studio which was private and quiet. They supplied us with all the necessities we needed for a comfortable stay, fruits from their garden, coffee and condiments, and a nice sized fridge in the room. An indoor shower in our room as well as an outdoor shower to clean off the unavoidable mud from adventuring! We are so grateful to have had this quiet landing pad after long excursions with a firm bed to come home to. They have tips for staying cool and a fan in the room. We got to see lots of cute geckos climbing outside and explore garden critters and kitty cats. Very hard to leave!"

As is mentioned in other reviews, the wifi is spotty but can be accessed if you move closer to the main house. I would absolutely stay here again and have already recommended it to friends!"

For example, they let us borrow their bbq on their back porch, and Coral told us to feel free to use her fresh herbs (including chili and thyme, which were amazingly fresh and delicious). The grounds are beautiful and interesting to explore and look around. It was very rainy when we visited so it was nice to have a hot tub to relax in when beaches were windy and rainy. The room was smaller than I expected but it is how it is pictured. The house itself is very beautiful and relaxing."

The ocean in front of the property was perfect for the kids to swim, fishing, diving, snorkeling, paddle boarding.. Etc.. Everything was so convenient grocery stores, places to eat and getting in and out of the property was a breeze.  It's a very quiet area where you can relax and just get away from it all. We will most definitely consider staying here again!! "

We had a big group and there was plenty of space, enough bathrooms, tons of space to cook and all the tools/ amenities we needed to do everything we wanted. The private beach was fantastic. So close to the Polynesian center and a good in-between spot for tons of hikes, beaches, shops and food. \r\n\r\nNoah was incredibly helpful, responsive and discreet so we never felt like didn't have the privacy we needed in our own little get away!"

The entire island is out of this world beautiful, but this property's secluded location and private beach make the ocean views that much more special and breathtaking. I booked the home as accommodation for my wedding party guests (my husband and I had a small, beach wedding in the North Shore) and it was perfect. We had everything we needed and the extra beds in each room saved me headache and money - very efficient! Noah was also quite accommodating when I told him our original plan of having the ceremony on the private beach and outside reception in the backyard (which we didn't wind up doing) - he was totally cool with it. Overall, a wonderful Hawaii experience in a lovely beach home where I felt at home and completely relaxed. "

The home was large enough for 9 of us and we never felt cramped or in each other's way. The Polynesian Center is 2 minutes away, and there is so much to do there. Northshore offers a very local Hawaii feeling, and was so much fun to explore! Thank you Noah and family for being gracious and attentive hosts! We would definitely go back our beautiful private beach!"

August, it was hot and humid, but all the fans that were provided kept us cool. At night it was even more cool with the wonderful ocean breeze. We love the that we had a beach right there. My kids played in the sand the whole time! we went swimming when we can, the tide was higher in the afternoon. There was some much room for everyone to spread out and relax! There were local supermarket close by too, so convenient!! Thank you again Noah!"

Being winter we missed out on beach access as the tide was in, but it didn't stop us taking advantage of the private water access and sitting out on the steps. There were food trucks and cafes and restaurants nearby, as well as grocery stores within a short driving distance. The rustic feel of Laie is so much more pleasant than the hustle and bustle of Waikiki. "

          "comments": "This beach house is an absolute gem and some of the photos just don't do it justice. From the moment you walk into the front door, you have stunning views of the ocean. We enjoyed breathtaking sunrises from the master bedroom and outdoor sunbathing pad almost every day. We chose this location for our intimate wedding ceremony and casual dinner for about 45 friends and family. We originally planned both the ceremony and dinner outdoors, but due to the unusually windy weather, we decided to host the dinner in the spacious living room instead, which worked out great. Noah was very responsive and helpful before we arrived in Hawaii, as well as throughout the wedding weekend. Unlike previous reviewers, we had no issues with the hot water, the floors were clean when we arrived, and flies only became an issue when we left the doors open for long periods of time. There wasn't any sand on the beach in early March, but the water was calm and protected - perfect for wading around with water shoes. The house was fully stocked with amenities, and in a fantastic location if you're looking to get away from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki and Honolulu. I would highly recommend staying at Noah's beach house, and hope to find another reason to stay again in the future. Thank you Noah for making our weekend so memorable."

          "comments": "We loved staying at Noah\u2019s place! It was the perfect spot for our multi-family vacation. We had 6 adults, two teenagers and 4 kids ages 4 - 9. The water right in front of the house is the perfect spot for snorkeling and we saw lots of fish and a seal that came right by us a few times! When the tide is out the water is very calm. Around the corner is Pounders beach which has some decent waves for boogie boarding. It is a 5 minute walk to the Polynesian Cultural Center and about an hour from Honolulu. If you want a more slow paced vacation away from crowds then this is the perfect spot. We would absolutely stay here again in a heartbeat. Our whole group loved it."

The hot water was able to keep up with three showers going at the same time and the kitchen was plenty big enough for all.  The host was extremely easy to work with and had pre-stocked the house with pots/pans, paper towels, coffee, toilet paper, etc.\n\nThe best part about this house was the location, being right on the coast.  There is a nice back patio, and another concrete slab by the water with steps leading down to the beach.  The master bedroom has windows facing the ocean, so you can open the windows and hear the surf all night and wake up to the sunrise.\n\nI would most definitely rent this house again, and certainly from this renter."

With 4 bedrooms and 4 bathrooms we all felt like we had enough personal space and the large kitchen and living area was such an added bonus for so many bodies! The house has an enormous side/backyard with steps that lead to the perfect little private beach. We honestly had a hard time ever wanting to leave the house! The house came equipped with kayaks, canoes, boogie boards, and plenty of toys to keep us entertained! Noah and his family were beyond hospitable. They went out of their way to make sure everything was going smoothly and truly made us feel so welcome! We hope we get to come back soon!!!"

The yard, the lanai, the living room & kitchen all have ample space for everyone to spread out. The beach location is amazing and private; the reef & tides making it fun & safe for all ages.  Noah provides everything you could possibly need to make it the perfect Hawaiian vacation.  Four bathrooms & five showers make it the perfect spot for a girls getaway as well. We will certainly be planning additional adventures here in the future- highly recommended!"

Lovely, clean and quiet accommodation, welcoming host and many little things that made the experience enjoyable. \r\n\r\nAs an AirBnB newbie, I wasn't really sure on the protocols for communicating etc. However, Tracy made me feel relaxed and at home. She has a gorgeous, friendly dog and the place is immaculate - she had also left some fresh fruit, juice and water which was super-welcome after arriving on a fairly late flight. All the linens, towels etc were of high quality, and the shower is fantastic!  No air-con, but it's a shady spot and the fan was fine, even on two warm summer evenings.\r\n\r\nIf you are in Narrabeen to stay for any length of time, I can highly recommend this as your perfect home away from home."

Could have stayed by the pool all day! \r\nThere was a lovely selection of teas and some Orange Juice and fruit. While I didn't use much of the kitchen utensils - looked like there was everything you needed to make a nice meal if you were staying longer or wanted to cook.\r\nThe location is beautiful - easy to walk by Narrabeen lake. Tracy was very flexible and welcoming and easy to communicate with. A very easy experience overall.\r\n"

Lovely artwork and beach themed decor to make the place feel like home at the beach.\n\nLots of off road parking and a very safe area to go for walks and enjoy the lake.  Highly recommend."

We loved having Sari pop by (the lovely vizsla) from time to time. Tracy is such a great host. She is always willing to help out or let you know what\u2019s happening in the area. It was so convenient to borrow the bikes and ride to the rock pool or any of the beaches along the coast. Tracy\u2019s place is a gem. We will definitely come back some time."

About a $20 cab ride from JFK-- was easier than navigating train later at night after long day."

Its clean, has a nice kitchen, and its in a nice neighborhood... a quick walk to the subway. She made me feel like I was a part of their family and that meant a lot because I am here alone.

The sheets were clean, the room is as pictured but I was cold in the middle of the night (but I'm always cold) also someone started playing music at 11pm until 11:45pm. It was very loud but not Lanes fault. I'd stay with Lane again"

Der war auch dringend notwendig, da es in New York im Juli sehr hei\u00df ist. Lane war sehr freundlich und aufmerksam.

During our stay we didn't have much Interaktion with Lane and Annette though,  since we were gone exploring the city most of the time. The room was fine and just like depicted, but, as mentioned in previous comments, quite hot. The subway was only a short walk away, however, if there were constructions or delays, it sometimes took us over an hour to get into Manhatten - so just be aware of that. If you are planning to cook while in New York, I wouldn't necessarily recommend their place as the kitchen was rather poorly equipped and the cupboards above the stove were pretty greasy. Altogether: if you are just staying for a couple of nights and don't expect to be right at the edge of Manhatten, it's a good place to stay at. "

Althought there was a slight effort of communication between us and Anette, I didn't really feel that welcomed like with our previous hosts, which might have made me look little bit uneasy. There was also very big traffic around the single bathroom which took away little bit of our privacy. In any case the apartament title is not misleading. It was a very clean and comfortable stay.\r\n"

Our stay in New York is like staying in a new home away from home. We do not have issues on safety. The walk towards Union Turnpike Station is around 10mins from our place. Lane's place is highly recommended for tourists and travelers who needed a room to stay for their vacation."

The apartment and the guest room was clean and pleasant. The apartment is located on the third floor of the building and it is worth noting the room lacks central air conditioning but there are quiet fans placed in the room so it's not a big deal. I definitely recommend this as a great value for anyone who wants somewhere to stay in Queens."

The apartment was very clean and you get your own set of keys to go in and out as you wish. Overall great affordable place to stay and super friendly hosts. Would stay again."

The area is safe, once I came back at 4 a.m. and I had no problems. Close to the JFK airport and La Guardia airport, taxi to the JFK airport is about 20$.It takes 30-40 min to get to Manhattan, which is not bad for such a big city. I spent in this apartment about 10 days and I was always happy to come back after a long day. Highly recommend!"

I was actually out and about pretty much the whole time from the moment I landed so I only dealt with Anette, but she was super friendly and pleasant. They keep their place clean and presentable so be sure to take your shoes off at the door! Their spot is in Jamaica, Queens and about an 8-10 min walk to the F and E trains at the Kew Gardens stop so it's super easy to get to and from the city and JFK. If you love NY pizza as much as I do, there's a spot not far from the trains on Queens Blvd right next to the McDonlads and a cafe as well as other eateries and shops. However, if you'd prefer to cook, they do have a kitchen, which I did not take advantage of. Again, I was out and about pretty much the whole time, but Lane's place is an excellent place if you need a clean bed and shower. Oh, and if I'm not mistaken I saw a Keurig, which I also did not take advantage of, but if you need some caffeine to start your day, then boom!"

The location is within walking distance from the Kew Gardens E/J Subway, and close to stores and fast food.  It is also right next to a major highway in Queens, which makes for easy road access.  The exact apartment is a bit hard to find so I recommend communications with Lane as the date of the stay gets closer so that she can help you find her place and coordinate your check-in.  The room is located in a third-floor apartment, and you need to use stairs to get there.  Lane is a fantastic host.  She is very responsive on email and helpful.  In all, I had a good experience because of the location and Lane's hospitality."

Everyone has a great time, we were very close to the amazing Magic Sands Beach and a short drive away from Kona shopping, groceries and dining. We loved the snorkel sets and beach chairs included in this listing. The kitchen was great for our homemade family breakfasts and dinners too. We spent every evening on the wrap-around lanai, it was gorgeous. We would recommend Jubilee by the Sea to our family and friends. MAHALO! \n"

The house was perfect for a group of friends/family, and a nice touch that we could borrow beach-gear for free. Didnt miss anything! A bit too far from the beach though, and we had to use the car to/from everything, which is the only minus to this house. Would definetly recommend it!!"

The lanai out front was our favorite place to relax and gather morning and evening.  The beds were very comfortable.  The refrigerator was huge.  With a car, we had easy access to the whole coast north and south of Kona.  The snorkeling and other beach gear that came with the house also made our stay easier and more fun!\nThe only con: Two members of our group needed the A/C to sleep.  We found that the A/C in the bedrooms upstairs were kind of loud as it shut off and on through the night.  And the house rule of running it at a 75 degree minimum still seemed warm to us.  But it was still better than nothing, since we didn't want to keep all the bedroom doors open all night to catch the cross breezes (for privacy and to manage the snorers).\nOverall, I would easily recommend this place!

Loved the wraparound lanai, especially with the lovely view of the ocean.  We cooked most of our meals at the house so it was convenient and helped us save a ton of money.  We also enjoyed eating out at the restaurants suggested by Nate (we loved Lava Java).  The house is fully equipped with beach equipment/toys which we didn't really use (we brought our own) but know that it's there.  Easy access to town and highway.  Overall highly recommend this home and cannot wait to visit the Big Island again and will definitely want to stay here again."

We went to Kona for a family wedding and it was great to have a big house together as opposed to several hotel rooms. In the mornings we had coffee on the lanai while we looked out at the ocean--so lovely! Nate was a wonderful host. He got back to us right away each time we needed something. We did wish for AC window units in the downstairs bedrooms like the ones upstairs. But we were there in August, the hottest time of the year. It probably wouldn't be a big deal to go without AC most of the year. There is usually a nice ocean breeze. Overall, it's a wonderful place and we would definitely recommend it! :)"

Much laughter was had at his home and much loved was shared with our family, from renewal of wedding vows for my husband and I, 1 year anniversary for my daughter and her husband and my husband finishing the Iron Worlds 2017. I would HIGHLY recommend this house to anyone wanting to stay close to the beaches and also so close to in town shopping and activities. Thank you so much Nate!!! God Bless!!"

There was an upstairs and downstairs living space and refrigerator.\n\nAmenities offered included beach chairs which was great for us - these were to be shared with another property.  We didn\u2019t notice any beach towels but perhaps we didn\u2019t look hard enough since we had our own.  \n\nI admit that I did not realize that only the upstairs living room and bedrooms had AC units, but it was written in the description so I do not fault the host for this - some of our party were very hot downstairs so they just stayed upstairs.  Washer and dryer were on premises but locked up unless asked for - we did have to buy our own laundry detergent.\n\nAll in all, the description was accurate regarding the home.  We did have a great time in the home and we enjoyed our stay.  I appreciated Nate\u2019s extremely prompt responses to any questions I had about the place and being as accommodating as possible."

The room facing west is especially warm before midmight but manageable for some of the group members. The matresses are very comfortable."

The rooms are spacious and beds were super comfy. The full kitchen had everything we needed to prepare a dinner and enjoy it out on the lanai if we didn\u2019t feel like going out to eat.  We spent most of mornings and evenings out on the wrap around Lani enjoying the  birds and surroundings. The outside shower was nice to have to make sure the sand was off the kids. Beach equipment, such as chairs,umbrella and snorkel gear was what we needed to head out and enjoy the beautiful beaches. (And it was nice We didn\u2019t have to rent)  Thanks again Nate for everything\u2014till next time "

Our trip was scheduled right when Hurricane Lane was coming through Hawaii, and we were a little nervous that we may not be able to make it to the Big Island on our original schedule. Once I communicated with Nate about our schedule concerns, he went above and beyond to keep me updated about the current weather conditions on the island and in Kona, which really kept me at ease. The house itself is beautiful and is in a great location for sightseeing. I loved the amenities the house provided, including the snorkel gear. I would highly recommend staying here and would definitely come back!"

Lots of great eateries & convenience stores nearby as well, including the famous Kau Kee Beef Brisket Noodles! Do note the small details like that there is (currently) no wifi & no lift, but we knew about these so we were prepared for it. One small thing, the curtains are quite sheer over the full-length windows which makes the whole place bright & airy, but if you're used to sleeping in darkness then I recommend bringing eyeshades."

Apartment itself is spacious enough for one (and I reckon up to two) and has most essentials required - although this being HK, didn't get to spend much time in it. The lack of a lift in this block means legging it up several flights of stairs (as host has made known to her credit) but even that is a perfect antidote to the great food and drink the city has to offer. Mai-Britt was most friendly and welcoming, and the whole experience (as a first-time user) was smoother than I'd expected."

Dog er der ikke nogen havem\u00f8bler, men vi fandt dog 3 gamle plaststole i et vaskeskur.\r\nVirker lidt som en hurtig indt\u00e6gtskilde, dog med fin service n\u00e5r man henvender sig ( bl.a. med en defekt aircondition der l\u00e6kker vand p\u00e5 hele gulvet. Tydeligt en gammel skade med gamle skjolde p\u00e5 v\u00e6g).\r\nUdlejer kendte ikke til P-huse og priser i n\u00e6rheden. Der ligger dog et ca. 30 meter rundt om hj\u00f8rnet, der for \u00f8vrigt er til at forhandle pris med.\r\nVil klart anbefale at man er max 3 personer i denne lejlighed !"

Quite neighborhood and building which is really nice for active travelers who need to rejuvenate after long days and nights of sightseeing.  The kitchen had the basics for quick meal prep if you eat in a couple of times.  Clean new bathroom with a large shower.  Great large patio which does get hot during the day.  Gabriela and Miquel were accommodating and get back to you very quickly with answers to any questions you may have.  I was new to the airbnb experience and it could not have gone better being quests of these two hosts. Our family of four did well in the bed situation. One double bed in a small bedroom, a twin in a smaller bedroom and a double pull out couch.  Internet was strange a couple of times but it could just have needed a siesta! If we every have an opportunity to come back to Barcelona, I will be contacting Gabriela and Miquel!"

Me aloj\u00e9 en el apartamento de Gabriela pues queda muy cerca del mismo (5-7 minutos paseando). \r\n\r\n\u00bfC\u00f3mo son las habitaciones?:\r\nLa habitaci\u00f3n principal da a un patio interior de la comunidad, es muy tranquila, se oye un poco la maquinaria del ascensor por el d\u00eda porque est\u00e1 cerca, pero por la noche es silenciosa ya que el edificio es de ambiente familiar, acogedor y se respeta el descanso nocturno. De cualquier modo la zona es tranquila, y de noche mucho m\u00e1s. No hay ruido de tr\u00e1fico ni nada por el estilo. Yo descans\u00e9 muy bien.\r\nLa habitaci\u00f3n peque\u00f1a en realidad es un espacio semiabierto que se comunica con el sal\u00f3n. Y da a la terraza principal. Suuuuper tranquila.\r\n\r\nPositivos:\r\n- El apartamento es un sobre\u00e1tico as\u00ed que no hay vecinos en esa planta, s\u00f3lo t\u00fa. La terraza es incre\u00edble, vistas maravillosas sobre los tejados y colinas al atardecer. En mi caso era casi octubre y ya refrescaba por la noche pero me imagin\u00e9 que en verano se estar\u00eda muy bien cenando all\u00ed mismo. \r\n- El Aire Acondicionado funciona perfectamente, de maravilla. Y lo hay en todas las estancias. \u00a1De lujo!\r\n- WIFI disponible.\r\n- El piso est\u00e1 nuevo y muy limpio. Las fotos se corresponden con la realidad. No hay sorpresas. Decorado sin artificios. B\u00e1sico pero funcional.\r\n- Farmacia y supermercado en la misma calle, as\u00ed como papeler\u00eda y varios bares y cafeter\u00edas. \r\n- Boca de metro a escasos metros.\r\n\r\nPosibles Negativos (seg\u00fan necesidades del viajero):\r\n- El agua caliente de la ducha se agota de all\u00ed a un tiempo (calentador) y hay que esperar a que el tanque est\u00e9 nuevamente caliente. Para mi que viajaba sola, era m\u00e1s que suficiente para una agradable y larga ducha. Para m\u00e1s personas supongo habr\u00eda que tenerlo en cuenta y programarse. O ser breve (ecofriendly!) De cualquier modo es un aspecto menor.\r\n- El ascensor llega hasta el \u00e1tico. Para llegar al sobre\u00e1tico hay que subir un peque\u00f1o tramo de escaleras. Para mi no supuso ning\u00fan problema, ni lo supondr\u00e1 para cualquier viajero joven y en forma. Pero est\u00e1 bien saberlo en caso de personas con problemas de movilidad o para quienes lleven equipajes muy pesados.\r\n\r\nRealmente no son aspectos negativos sino simplemente a tener en cuenta! Mi estancia fue muy agradable y sin incidencias con una perfecta comunicaci\u00f3n con mi anfitri\u00f3n. As\u00ed que recomiendo este apartamento sin dudarlo.\r\n\r\nGracias Gabriela!\r\n\r\n"

He was very welcoming and immediately began to assist us with our luggage etc. The apartment looks just like the photos. It was very clean, comfortable and the terrace was awesome. We spent several nights overlooking the city while we enjoyed wine and cava! The metro was about 2 minutes away making travel around the city easy. We used the local supermarket and fresh fruit stands for some basic supplies. We ate at a local restaurant and shared a pitcher of sangria. The waitress went out of her way to help us! Everything was really nice. Prior to our trip, Gabriela answered all my emails very promptly. I would definitely rent this apartment again!"

It is in a quiet, safe neighborhood and is a 2 minute walk from a metro station, where you can quickly and easily get downtown. Having two separate bedrooms was awesome for our group and we really liked the renovated kitchen, bathroom, private laundry, and living space. The private rooftop patio was a pleasant surprise and was one of the highlights of our trip to Europe. Both Miguel and Gabriela were super friendly and accommodating to our needs. I cannot recommend this apartment enough!"

The location was great in terms of amenities, access to metro and ability to walk to a number of tourist attractions. The terrace is a great place to spend time. I will happily book this apartment the next time I travel to Barcelona.\nThe only drawback is there are no loungers on the terrace, we bought cheap yoga mats at a shop around the corner though and these were a fair substitute.

He was such great help and accomodating as we had issues meeting our friends in Barcelona. The location is perfect,it is close to a metro and its minutes from Las Ramblas via walking or by bus but it is not crowded. there are a lot of little cafes and close to a supermarket. There were 5 of us and we were all very comfortable in the space. Highly recommended and I will definitely book this apartment again when I return to Barcelona. GRACIAS!!!"

Gabriela and Miguel are great hosts and everything from booking the apartment via the check-in, the stay to the check-out went absolutely uncomplicated. Even though my plane was delayed and I was more than one hour late, Miguel came to the apartment to hand over the keys. The flat itself is very clean and lovely furnished and it has all the comforts you need for your stay. The roof terrace is the perfect place to enjoy your breakfast or to relax in the evening and you have all the possibilities to access the public transportation via Sants Est. or Entenca. WiFi-Code and towels are provided as well.\r\nAlthough located in a central and busy area of the city you don't hear much of the noise of the streets and the neighbors are also quiet and friendly. Several supermarkets are just around the corner (both the small ones and bigger ones like a Mercadona and a Bonpreu). And if you prefer to go out for your meals, there are some nice caf\u00e9s and restaurants in the area.\r\nIn summary: If you are looking for a nice and spacious accomodation for your stay in BCN, this is probably a very good choice!"

Everything was as described, the interior nicely modern and we (young couple) had more than enough space in the apartment (living room, two bedrooms, kitchen/dining room). But the best was probably the great roof terrace, from where you have a great view over the city. The hosts, Gabriela and her husband Miguel, are really nice and open to any questions. We can only recommend this apartment and would always go there again."

Read my first assessment for further details concerning flat, environment and all that. \r\nGabriela and Miguel were so very accomodating again this time with everything, so I'd love to stay in their apartment again, when I come to BCN next time. Thanks for the good time to both of you!"

La terrasse est tr\u00e8s grande, il y a une petite table et des chaises \u00e0 disposition, c'est v\u00e9ritablement LA valeur ajout\u00e9e du lieu.\r\nA noter : la petite chambre avec le lit une place est situ\u00e9e au niveau du salon (isol\u00e9e par une porte coulissante).

Asunto oli loistava pienelle perheelle ja tarvittaessa siell\u00e4 olisi mahtunut y\u00f6pym\u00e4\u00e4n useampikin. Asunto vastasi t\u00e4ysin kuvausta,  tai oli jopa parempi! Kuvat eiv\u00e4t anna oikeutta asunnolle. Asunto on hiljattain remontoitu, todella siisti ja erityismaininta jokaisessa huoneessa erikseen olleesta ilmastointilaitteesta. Tullessamme, asunto oli siivottu todella siistiksi ja tuoksui raikkaalta -melkein kuin olisi tullut hotelliin! Asunto oli my\u00f6s hyvin rauhallinen, naapureista ei kuulunut mit\u00e4\u00e4n \u00e4\u00e4ni\u00e4. \r\n\r\nMy\u00f6s Miguel ja Gabriella toimivat loistavia is\u00e4ntin\u00e4: heid\u00e4t sai hyvin kiinni ennen matkaa, aiemman check-in ajan sopiminen onnistui ongelmitta, asunnolla oltiin vastaanottamassa meit\u00e4 hyviss\u00e4 ajoin, Miguel auttoi meit\u00e4 kantamaan matkatavaramme asuntoon, ongelmatilanteissa saimme apua muutaman tunnin sis\u00e4ll\u00e4 ja he jopa l\u00e4hettiv\u00e4t asunnolle unohtuneet matkatavarat postilla per\u00e4\u00e4mme! \r\n\r\nAsunnon l\u00e4heisyydest\u00e4 l\u00f6ytyi metroasema, pieni\u00e4 kauppoja ja edullisia paikallisten suosimia ravintoloita, joskin niiss\u00e4 ymm\u00e4rrettiin melko heikosti englantia :). Asunnolta oli jonkin verran matkaa esim. Tripadvisorin suosittelemiin ravintoloihin eixamplessa, mutta metrolla p\u00e4\u00e4si kulkemaan suht vaivattomasti my\u00f6s lapsen kanssa.\r\n\r\nAsunto ja is\u00e4nn\u00e4t olivat siis huippuja! Enemp\u00e4\u00e4 emme olisi voineet toivoa asunnolta t\u00e4ss\u00e4 hintaluokassa. Yksi asia, mik\u00e4 kannattaa kuitenkin huomioida t\u00e4m\u00e4n asunnon kohdalla on se, ettei hissill\u00e4 p\u00e4\u00e4se suoraan asunnon kerrokseen vaan hissilt\u00e4 tarvitsee nousta viel\u00e4 yksi kerros yl\u00f6sp\u00e4in portaita pitkin.\r\n\r\nKiitos majoittamisestamme, viihdyimme hyvin asunnossanne!"

We did purchase a small lawn chair from a shop across the street to lounge in the sun and left it for future guests to enjoy. Laundry set up is great. Washer is in a small room on the terrace which is also where you hang the clothes for drying. That little hotbox gets the clothes dry in a hurry. \r\nNeighborhood was exactly what we wanted. Good bars, restaurants and markets in the area, so good neighborhood feel away from main tourist streets and crowds. Walk a few blocks to The Bar on Calabria. Outstanding small restaurant with friendly owner and great food well priced.\r\nYou could walk everywhere (we did!), but better to get a metro pass (as we also did) which will get you everywhere. A stop (Entenca) is less than half a block away. We got a ten trip pass which lasted a week. Also, nothing quite like  crowding onto a sweaty subway in July to get to know the locals....\r\nWe highly recommend this apartment as the perfect way to enjoy a stay in Barcelona!"

The appartment is nice and cosy and provided everything we needed for 3 people (additional sofa bed available). Communication with host was smooth and prompt, we appreciated the possibility of late check-out. We enjoyed our stay and would certainly recommend the appartment to families and to those who like to return to a quiet neighborhood after hustle and bustle of the city."

(Note on eating places avoid the Raco De Rossello (we all had very dodgy constitutions after a tapas there).) \nVery close to L5 metro and no 41 bus goes to Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya. For three people taxis are a good and economic way of getting around especially after a long day walking around. \nFlat has effective A/C and is quiet apart from lift motor noise.\nIf there any negatives then new fatter pillows would be good and a plug for the bathroom sink would be great but apart from those minor quibbles the flat is perfect."

The apartment is very spacious, very clean and has all the amenities . Wifi was with a very good speed , kitchen had everything needed during the whole stay , all the apartment was air conditioned, the very big terrace is a real asset to this apartment and it is also private so you can enjoy your breakfast or noon tea in it , the building has an elevator not that big but it was enough for the 4 of us . The location of the apartment is more than perfect,  you have everything around you , less than 50 meters to the metro station of \"Entenca\" and another one also . All stores are in a very small walking distance from the building like : Supermarkets , cafes , money transfer , Bakery stores , korean restaurants,  massage and spa , souvenirs...Etc . I strongly recommend Gabriela's apartment to anyone who is planning to roam Barcelona and to have a good and clean place to stay in . Last thing is the very quiet and safe area/neighborhood. "

Plenty of bars, convenience stores, pharmacies, etc around.. Gabriela was very accommodating.

This place is very large for hk around 1000 sqft!

If you once find this place, you will relalise how close it is from Soho, but getting here for the first time wasn't very easy for us. I stayed here with my husband and my brother's family and the place was spacious enough (considering its hongkong) for us all to hang around. You need to walk up to the 4th floor but wasn't a problme at all to us. \nWe had some issue about electricity but Melanie responded quickly and helped us sort out the problem. One thing we felt inconvenient was hot shower but we got used to it later. And, it was very considerate of Melanie to prepare three heaters for us. \nI highly recommend this place for a family or groups of 4-5 ppl and especially those who wish to enjoy the atmosphere of Soho area and lankwaifong. I and my husband went out for a drink every night and found awesome bars and restaurants. We could have done it easily as the place is so close to it. \n"

I've stayed in many overpriced, cramped hotels and hostels in Hong Kong over the years and this was my first time opting for AirBnB instead. I was not disappointed. Melanie's apartment is very very spacious, has a lot of character and is super comfortable. It's also fantastic value for money if a few of you are sharing. Her instructions of how to find and access the building were spot on, very helpful indeed. \r\n\r\nWe'll be back for sure!"

When I checked in, the house was in a huge mess as the previous guest had trashed the listing and looked like they had a party there. Melanie was easily reachable and wasn't fazed much when I showed her pictures. Instead, she took it like a champ and pulled a miracle by getting her cleaner to come at midnight. I was calling Airbnb to move my reservation elsewhere but her ability to rectify everything in record time was all I could ask for. The apartment looked great for photos after the massive cleanup! Thank you!"

Construction site nearby was a bit noisy but we all slept fine. Convenience store on the corner very handy.\n\nThe place was spacious and clean. Shower had good flow and no trouble with hot water. Fridge small but all we needed. Plenty of markets and eateries around and the MTR (train) station is only a short walk and one stop to central.\n\nWe're able to drop our bags slightly earlier which was also very helpful in the heat.\n\nI would definitely stay at Melanie's place again.\n\nCheers for having us."

The place was quite and nice, clean and comfy just like the picture. Have a bit problems with the light inside the room but she response quick and ask for the helper to come.

So we passed by Jenny's Bakery (which is famous) then another alley  with stairs  at the end you'll see a 711 store straight ahead that's kau u fong or the LKF Hotel stated at her directions. Now follow her given direction.   Lan Kwai Fong is minutes by foot & neighboorhood is quiet. \r\nJust to note again unit is on the 4th floor,no elevator,\r\n\r\nButnonetheless considerable unit for the next visit,two thumbs up!"

The building itself represents typical older HK style, nothing too fancy to expect, but apartment upstairs is a good pick for a small group or a family searching good value for the money. As described, there is no elevator which of course would be nice when going up with heavy luggage or for elderly persons, but in general there's nothing really to complain. Apartment is located in a walking distance from both Sheung Wan and Central / Hong Kong stations, and frequents trams and buses go along the Des Voeux Rd as well. There are a lot of restaurants nearby, both local style (e.g. Wellington Street) as well as more international ones + bars (go uphill towards SOHO). A great stay, recommended."

The apartment is right in the heart of Central and walking distance to the MTR, restaurants and LKF. I had a wonderful stay and highly recommend this apartment for anyone visiting HK in a larger group. "

The apartment itself fit four comfortably, and had plenty of places to sit and relax, good cold fridge and some cooking facilities. The decor made it feel more homely. It is an older style apartment though so has a few rough edges (adds character)."

The building core is under renovation so outside you are completely surrounded by scaffolding and renovation supplies. Inside the apartment however is a pleasant oasis of calm and we would certainly return.   Enjoyed the proximity to PMQ!"

Der Eingang ist etwas versteckt, aber daf\u00fcr hatten wir eine wirklich sehr ausf\u00fchrliche Beschreibung bekommen, mit der wir gut zurecht gekommen sind. Die Wohnung ist sch\u00f6n gro\u00df und ger\u00e4umig und bietet Platz f\u00fcr 5 Personen. Die Einrichtung ist relativ einfach, Bad und Dusche sind nicht mehr die allerneuesten aber es was das bestm\u00f6gliche draus gemacht. Die K\u00fcche haben wir nicht benutzt, weil in direkter Umgebung einfach sehr gute Essensm\u00f6glichkeiten gibt. Vegetarier sollten sich vorab informieren um gr\u00f6\u00dfere Entt\u00e4uschungen zu vermeiden."

The location is just amazing...right between Soho and Sheung Wan, close to a lot of sights and restaurants in walking distance. So central and still so quite. We definitely recommend to come here. Wifi could be a bit stronger though - but instead the water pressure in the shower is strong, which is not easy to find in HGK. Contact to Mel was great! Thank you "

The furniture are old, renovation are worn, doors are coming lose, toilet doors eroded from water damage, dirty spots around the house. Cleaning inventories and equipment placed in a messy manner. Renovation wise on the whole it looks good but can be seen it was done without much regards to quality; exposed wires and piping, holes in wall not filled. This was an apartment quickly converted to make money from Airbnb. Will not recommend unless you are just looking for good venue and a place to sleep at night."

Gets a little loud as it is so close to the Soho/LKF action, but it should be what you are choosing this place for. 4F(starts from 'Ground') stairs might be demanding sometimes, but is a common thing in HK. Host was great in terms of communication etc."

And it was hard to cook a home meal as it\u2019s not really set up for cooking for a family. We decided to eat out after the first night. \nAll in all a pleasant stay in a authentic traditional Hong Kong apartment. Highly recommended. "

As someone who has, until recently, lived in HK my whole life, I know how expensive rents are there, but (despite the apartment\u2019s great location), it\u2019s utterly outrageous to pay so much for so very little. \nOh, and to call it \u201chuge\u201d in the ad is a blatant lie. Hats off to whoever took the ridiculously misleading photos as well. The truth is that this is a small, scummy, dark, depressing abode with zero charm or character.

Just need to be mindful that there is no lift to the 4th floor apartment and it can get a bit noisy outside, but the location and spaciousness of the apartment more than made up for that, for us."

The space is pretty big space for HK and it was nice to have a relaxing space we could all come back to after a whole day of site seeing. Melanie was very accommodating and responsive. The place is walk up so it\u2019s good for light travelers. I would come back to stay next time again!"

The studio itself is light and bright, as well as clean and comfortable. Cath was a welcoming and attentive hostess who was not only knowledgeable and helpful with all our queries, but provided a wonderful breakfast hamper with home made goodies that really made us feel welcome. The garden setting and chooks only added to our experience. We loved the location and enjoyed exploring the adjoining areas such as Newtown and Surry Hills.\r\nThoroughly recommended."

We arrived and were greeted by the very friendly and attentive Cath - who introduced us to the chickens on the way to the studio. As soon as we stepped inside we felt comfortable. The decor is modern, quirky and stylish, there is a lovely area to sit and watch television, a user friendly kitchenette, a comfortable bed and a clean and modern bathroom. Cath provided us with a lovely array of breakfast and snack options and she even baked a delicious loaf of fresh bread which she left at our doorstep the following morning along with a newspaper. There is a large collection of DVD's to watch and books to read and the studio is in a quiet location with plenty parking - also within easy walking distance of public transport. I highly recommend The Garden Studio to anyone looking for a private, convenient and comfortable place to stay. My partner and I will definitely be returning in the future. "

Cath is a very smiling and nice person. The studio is fully adjust to feel like home.\r\nThe basket for breakfast is really complete and everything is thinked that we lacked nothing. Moreover it was a pleasure to be able to taste the delicious biscuits and bread, all home made by Cath. The bus stations and shops are close and there are only 15 minutes walking to go to the station Petersham.\r\nI really recommend Cath's studio !"

Marrickville is being hailed as the \"new Surry Hills\" and at the number of quality cafes and food stores nearby was just astounding. We rented a car, and we were really happy with the easy (and free) parking on the street too."

Cath was approachable & helpful when we needed info on how to get around, but at the same time, gave us the space we needed. Her chickens too, were rather welcoming! A joy to talk to; we appreciated the short exchanges & enjoyed listening to her share bits about herself :) \r\n\r\nA gem of a place! \r\n"

Why I'd recommend you stay:\r\n\r\n* Lots of privacy, with your own entrance...\r\n\r\n* Cath is a very generous, understanding, and thoughtful host, and easy to contact. We particularly loved her guides about where to eat in the local area.\r\n\r\n* TGS is very well located in the central suburb of Marrickville - easy to get into the CBD/Newtown/Surry Hills, and if you drive like me, never any complications with street parking!\r\n\r\n* The studio was meticulous, and very well stocked - Cath filled the fridge/kitchen with nearly everything you'd need... The variety of teas and delicious homemade cookies were mostly appreciated, and I'm sure most Airbnb users are interested in an espresso machine, which was also available!\r\n\r\n* The shower in this place is truly amazing.\r\n\r\nAll in all, if you don't mind a smaller place, this is the place for you - we found it worked well for 2 people. Thank you again Cath. :-)"

Handed a loaf of baked bread straight from the oven within moments was an unexpected delight. The beautifully styled and thoughtfully prepared space is ideal. We felt that the attention to detail was the best we have experienced using AirBNB. From the generously stocked fridge and hamper, bathroom items, games, videos and books and even picnic gear it was clear the stylish owner is well travelled and knows how to make a space a temporary home. The kitchenette has everything you need. In fact the space and the lovely courtyard was so delightful we surprised ourselves by spending the first morning there enjoying a lazy breakfast reading the terrific range of wonderful magazines rather than head out. The location is great. At the end of the street is a lovely park where we were able to fit in a morning run. Very comfy bed, quality linen, a super quiet fan. Great information and maps were a welcome addition. We would love to return here and most likely will. Highly recommended. "

The studio has been cleverly designed and has a crispy clean, fresh, airy feel to it.  Cath was the perfect host who was there if I needed anything while also giving me a sense of privacy.  All your needs are met at The Garden Studio with extras of yummy home baked ginger biscuits and the morning paper delivered to your front door!  All this with a lush raindrop shower head made for delightful stay - it was a treat and a retreat all in one."

Everything is done to a really high quality level, from the sheets on the perfectly made bed to the spotless interior and the fantastic breakfast box Cath left for me.  The garden is a wonderful and quiet place to hang out, although it is definitely shared between you and the host.  Privacy feels more private that a room in someone else's house, but probably less than a stand-alone apartment - reasonable since it's a studio in someone's back garden.  The neighborhood is quiet and pretty, with nice cafes and a farmer's market a 15-minute walk.  Getting into and out of other places in the city takes a while; you are not in the center of things, but in a nice neighborhood.  A car or a bike would be more flexible than using transit.  Overall a great place that I would use again!"

She was very organised and had all the need to know information all sorted into a little file with all the maps, delivery menus etc. The location is great just about 15 mins away from the domestic airport and about 25 mins away from the international airport. Our favourite airbnb stay so far!"

I felt so comfortable staying there, that I completely forgot that it was located at the back of Cath's house. Cath has done an amazing job with making her guests feel welcome and well cared for. The breakfast hamper was beautiful (especially since I'm a fussy eater!!) fresh bread, home made jam, milk, juice, coffee, herbal teas etc etc was ALL provided. Being a tourist to Sydney, the information folder Cath has put together herself was extremely helpful. One night I tried one of her recommended restaurants and the food was amazing. I can't thank Cath enough for allowing me the privilege of staying in her beautiful studio."

We were warmly greeted by Cath, and Chips the dog, and once inside the studio there was a lovely hamper of breakfast foods, fresh bread, a coffee machine and various teas - breakfast then sorted for the next four days.\r\nThe studio is in Cath's garden, with a paved area and table and chairs for sitting in the sun.  While it is small it is very sunny and really well set out with modern furniture and we loved the loft bed.  The bathroom area has a shower curtain, not a door but that was not a problem for us. \r\nCath - thank you very much for making our stay so nice.  Your home baking left for us on one of the days was really thoughtful.  I highly recommend you and your Garden Studio.  \r\n"

A folder was available outlining all the local cafes, restaurants, hairdressers and any other professional you might need. Before we arrived Cath contacted us to ensure her breakfast hamper contained things we liked. In additional to the hamper, each day we were treated to a range of treats including fresh eggs, delicious cakes or freshly baked bread. Even the paper was delivered most days courtesy of Chips the guide dog in training. After eight days we rolled out of the Garden Studio wishing we could stay indefinitely. This standard was maintained with Cath being extremely busy with an enormous photo shoot as well as her impending wedding this weekend. What a wonderful find. We would definitely recommend Cath to our family and friends and in fact have done so,"

Tea and coffee choices were plentiful. There was a book full of maps, tips on things to do and see, menus for local restaurants and other useful contacts. \r\n\r\nThe space was quiet with no traffic noise, just the cluck of the friendly chickens and someone playing piano in a nearby house (not intrusively!).\r\n\r\nThe location was great for us. Close to several parks and a short walk to Marrickville shopping strip, restaurants, bars (Gasoline Pony) and the train station was about 30 mins walk away. Parking was easy.\r\n\r\nCommunication was easy and prompt which made it easy to change our plans which we had to do at short notice.\r\n\r\nWe'd highly recommend The Garden Studio to guests wanting a peaceful stay close enough to the city."

There was enough room for two of us to stay but cosy enough to make it feel comfortable. Being in Marrickville, it is so handy to where we wanted to be. \r\n\r\nThe breakfast Cath provided was amazing, such great hospitality. My girlfriend says Cath really knows the way to a girl's heart as there were plenty of amenities included with the stay, even a hairdryer and shampoo/conditioner, not to mention the fully stocked kitchen. \r\n\r\nCannot recommend enough for either singles or couples. Cath made us feel very welcome yet with enough privacy that we felt comfortable. "

She left us to our own devices most of the time, but was always available and forthcoming with great advice about the area and very generous with her delivery of home-baked bread, a muesli slice that she made and fresh eggs from her cooks. Marrickville is a really nice area - very quiet and relaxed, but with plenty of dining options within a 15 minute walk and the city and Newtown also very accessible via public transport. Highly recommended!"

We could walk to more in the area than we even managed to do in the 3 days we were there (so there is no shortage of great food or entertainment). Even with an air mattress on the downstairs floor my friend and I felt we had plenty of room.  We'd stay there again in a flash. Next time we'll bring our nona trolleys, and cooler bags and shop up on goodies from the Greek deli and places on illawarra rd."

The studio is just like it is shown in the pics being even better than a hotel stay. It is fully equipped with everything you need and it has everything as described on the Airbnb site. We were blown away with the fresh and tasty eggs Cath provided us from her own chickens on site. Her breakfast hamper has fresh bread, yogurt, muesli, milk and other baked goods that was more than what we needed. Cath is very thoughtful and considerate of her guests and will provide you all the information required to travel, eat and be like a local which is what we wanted to do in our Sydney stay. We also loved her sense of style and the way she has done up the Garden studio. Also there is a lovely vegetable patch with herbs and greens right outside the studio. Very pretty.  The little details matter like the umbrellas, picnic basket, extra blankets, etc that were provided to us. The studio is not located within the CBD area but that was not a problem at all since we were commuting around via trains and buses and did not find any issues doing so. Also it is in a suburb very close to the central area so you are still pretty close. Besides Marickville has some of the best food and coffee options that we explored in our trip. Stay at the Garden studio and you will not be disappointed. We were sad to leave and only wished we could have stayed longer. This has surely been our best AirBnb stay till date. \r\n\r\nP.S. Just make sure you are okay to stay in a loft like bed with a movable ladder to climb up and down which may not suit everyone. That was a highlight for us though and we wanted to experience it :) "

Every little detail had been thought of, and the bountiful breakfast basket was a delight, as was the little delivery from the bread fairy the following morning, and the fresh eggs from the little chickies in the garden :) The location was great - a very comfortable walking distance to Newtown and Marrickville which meant we were able to enjoy the great food, coffee and beer that the locality has to offer, as well as great theatre at the Depot. Cath's recommendations for local must-dos were much appreciated. The street is lovely and quiet, with a park at the end. Getting to and from the train was also a breeze. This is a rare gem, one which we will definitely be returning to! "

Cath provided us with fresh bread and croissants for breakfast which was just the cherry on top of a wonderful stay. Cath is a friendly host who will assist you with anything you need.

Cath was very lovely, accommodating, and understanding. We highly recommend her place to everyone. The place was very clean and there were milk, eggs, and a breakfast hamper when we arrived, plus fresh bread in the morning which was a lovely thing to wake up to. The kitchen and bathroom were kitted out with everything that a traveller ever needs plus more. We also loved that it was near a few train stations and bus stops, and it's just a pleasant walk to lively Newtown. Thanks again Cath for having us and for being so understanding! We couldn't rate your place highly enough, if we could give it 10 out of 5 stars we would! :) \n"

The breakfast hamper that is provided is a very thoughtful touch; cereal, muesli, baked beans, porridge oats, eggs, juice., freshly baked bread from the local bakery...Cath was also very accommodating with our dietary requirements-vegan- and provided us with almond milk, coconut yoghurt, dairy free margarine and coconut & chia puddings. \n\nFree parking outside was also a bonus and we never had any issues with finding a space.\n\nHighly recommend staying here!  \n"

We felt that Cath wants her guests feel really comfortable and happy in it. The breakfast basket with bread, eggs, milk and muesli made it complete. The Studio is not very big but it has everything which is needed. Very nice and lovely! a little treasury :)\n\nCath is very attentive, helpful and extremely pleasant. She was always reachable when we asked for insider tips or had questions concerning locations to visit. The \"cherry on top of the cake\" was that Cath brought us to the airport on our last day! Thanks again!\n\nSo for us it is not difficult to summarize that Cath (and her husband mark) are excellent \"super hosts\"! We loved the week in Marrickville and enjoyed the stay in the Garden Studio. Highly recommended!!! :)\n\nCath and Mark: Thank you very very much for being your guests! It was a great time in Sydney and your lovely Garden Studio. It was a pleasure meeting you!\n\nAnd: the next time you are in germany near to us... you already know... :)"

The room comes with a private toilet without shower. so we took our shower at the shared bathroom outside the room. You can tell that they are very thoughtful host by looking at how equipped is the room. They provide mineral water, boiler, instant coffee tea, snacks, facial masks, sunscreens, lotion, umbrella, various sizes of towels etc in the room. The location was perfect as it's within walking distance to Harbour Plaza (less than 10 mins) where I attended a conference. Quarry bay station and bus stops to Causeway bay etc are very near too. The bus stop for A12 bus to airport is just located opposite the building. Overall, We had a pleasant and comfortable stay. "

They have all that you need: linens, water, snacks, juice etc. and someone to clean twice a week. Their two cats are friendly and cute! I really loved Quarry Bay as well, quiet with some great restaurants/bars and a gym near by. Definitely recommend this place to others and will recommend to my friends visiting Hong Kong!!!! "

Joanna is really quick to respond to messages if you need anything as well. our room was cleaned 1x while we stayed there, they always had water for us which was nice, you can ask for extra towels depending on how long you're staying. we stayed 11 days so it was nice that we didn't have to worry about anything that we didn't have. If you love cats or animals this is the place for you. They have 2 cats which are basically dogs they greet you at the door when you come in or leave, and in the morning if they know you're awake, they will meow at your door to let them in. This really made a great start to our day. the MRT in only a couple minute walk in either direction and it was really easy to get around. if I were to ever come back to Hong Kong I would definitly stay here again."

He personally greeted me warmly with a comforting plate of Italian pasta with kidney beans and smoked cheese. It was quite good. He gave me all the subway info I needed easily, and all his info was accurate. As if this guy hadn't done more than enough already, he ended up giving me a pair of tennis shoes bc my luggage didn't make it and I had no shoes suitable for walking the streets of NY. This place is awesome. You should consider yourself lucky if he has an opening for you.\n"

Our house is 600 feet from the ocean! Walk to snorkeling/swimming hole in 3 minutes! There isn't a beach right by house. A Hideaway quiet and peaceful, set in an authentic fishing village. Unwind and relax from city life and packaged vacations. Three bedroom, three baths, and game room. A large Lanai runs the length of the house for dolphin and whale watching. Have dinner on a beautiful Lanai and watch the incredible sunsets enjoy the warm climate with cool coastal breezes. One and half blocks to water access for swimming, snorkeling, kayaking, scuba diving and fishing. There are kayaks and boogie boards ... at t",
      "neighborhood_overview": "I love walking the streets to get exercise. Cars are traveling slowly in the neighbourhood. Speed limit is 15 miles per hour. The swimming hole is two minutes away- go northwest on Kai street to find- its over by the bay. That's where we put kayaks in. There are tide pools in the village and the wharf is a great snorkeling place as is the swimming hole by the house. There really isnt a beach close to the house but drive  into the village of Milolii  , the last hawaiian fishing village,park, and hike  15 minutes into Honomolino Beach, a pretty, quiet, black sand beach with a patch of white on the southern part.",
      "notes": "Seeing the dolphins in Papa bay and the humpback whales in the winter are a great experience.    Also, there are wild goats over on Umi Street. There are tide pools before you reach the community center on the right side. Buy fish in the village or up at the top of the hill- sushi grade Ahi tuna is wonderful!  Ono is also a great fish to cook in butter and enjoy.",
      "transit": "You  need to have a rental car for this house. Four  wheel drive is a great addition to your car experience on the island- there are lots of places on  the island to enjoy 4 wheel drive- you don't need it though to reach the house- roads are paved but curvy to the house.",
      "access": "There are boogie boards, snorkel gear and beach toys in the closet  on the first floor. There are a gazillion DVDS and netflix  in the house. The kayaks are great! There is a play station in the lower master and WII is in a box in the closet- feel free to use.",
      "interaction": "Most of the year  I am in California  so my interaction with guests is via email  but I am happy to answer any and all questions. There is an orange folder  titled Welcome Book on the desk or bar  with ideas of what to do plus there are guidebooks in the house. Please leave them for future guests when you leave. Daniel's latest favorite thing is manta ray diving on the Hang Loose Boat which is north of Kona.  Talk to him about it if you are interested! Everything is a drive on the Big Island so be prepared for that!",

I was born in Venezuela and have always worked on both English and Spanish, and am able to teach both languages.  My dream was to have a home in Hawaii.  I've have spent the last few years traveling  between CA  and many of the Hawaiian Islands in search of the perfect home.  We are settling on the shores of this quaint village.  I am married with one 15 year old son, and one dog Max. I love to hike and the kings trail is close to this house. I love nature and there are wild goats over on Umi street. I love to watch movies and there is netflix at the house. I love geckos and there are brown and green ones at the house. I like deals and the Aloha Beach house is one! There is a king bed now in the master- everytime we go we make the house nicer! It's nicer than our house in California. The master bedroom downstairs is very large and has a queen bed and futon. House can accomodate large groups; I just have to charge extra due to utilities. We get lots of family groups!\r\n\r\nThis beach house has been a 30 year dream in the making!  It is always so incredible when you see your dreams come true with belief and hard work. Please come and share the  Fantastic Sunsets at  Makai Hideaway- The sunsets are phenomenal and the snorkeling / swimming hole is a two minute walk from the house. The beach is a 15 minute hike from the community center in Milolii. I just enjoyed Easter services with the local people and it was wonderful at the little yellow church in the village. It really is a special place set  near  the last hawaiian fishing village\r\n",

The house is equipped with a lot of stuff that one might ever need for vacation: kayaks, tennis table, board games, TV with Netflix subscription, freezer with ice maker, etc.\r\n\r\nLynn, the house manager, was very welcoming and helpful. She made a nice intro when we arrived and tried to do whatever necessary to make our stay more pleasant. When we found ants in the kitchen, we told Lynn, and the next day the problem was solved.\r\n\r\nThe drawback I can think of is the lack of sound proofness, so when somebody goes to a bathroom it can be heard from the neighboring room. It was not a big deal though, since we rented the whole house.\r\n\r\nWe really enjoyed our stay at Aloha Beach House. Thank you, Cheryl and Lynn!!\r\n"

We found the location to be a great launching point to go to Kona and Hilo.  The house is situated near a historic fishing village and is on a lava field in a quiet community.  Don't let the trip down from the highway intimidate you, just take it slow, the end result is so worth the few miles of curvy road.  The view of the Pacific was amazing!  Cheryl and Lynn were so accommodating and even worked with us so we could stay an extra night.  They provided tips on where to go and helped orient us to the island.  When we come back to the Big Island, we will definitely stay at the Aloha Beach House.  We hope to be back soon. "

We could see the ocean from the living room and the kitchen. There is a huge collection of movies and games too. Lynn, the manager, is very nice and helpful. She gave us some very good information for us to plan our trip and shared some great storied from her own experience. She recommend an awesome bakery on our way to the volcano park. She also helped fix the TV promptly. The location is a little far from the popular area. But it was not a issue for us since my husband is a good driver and the view from the house and the house itself just offset the little inconvenience. We recommend this place to anyone who want to visit the big island and we hope to visit again the next time."

Three bedroom three bath gives everyone some privacy.  The downstairs bed/bath was my favorite because I could hear the ocean waves crashing.  The hosts have just about everything!  DVDs, Netflix, ice chests, boogie boards, kayaks.  They have a rec room with table tennis and pool table.  The outdoor lanai is great for BBQs and watching sunsets.  Great hosts- very prompt with communications and manager was around daily to answer questions.  About an hour from Kona and an hour and a half from Volcano."

For those of you who have never been to the Big Island, it is not the white sand beaches of postcards - but it is AMAZINGLY beautiful. This house sits in a field of lava overlooking dramatic cliffs. The drive down the hill is not for someone like my other (who is terrified of hights) but I loved driving it.  One of the best beaches on the island is only a 10 minute drive and 20 minute hike away, but be aware, you all have to drive to anywhere on this island. We brought some clothing detergent and left it and some salt and paper, we also left a card for the Big Island Chocolate Store frequent buyer card so the next people can take advantage of it and get some free chocolate. Spread the love if you come!"

We didn't actually end up staying at the house as were wanted to be around people, beaches, clubs, restaurants and bars. Lynn, the property manager was very helpful and Cheryl, the owner was very understanding in allowing us to leave without penalty. \r\nPros: \r\nBig spacious house with panoramic deck.\r\nBike, pool table and washer/dryer in basement. \r\nNice view of the water \r\nNeat interior design \r\nWhale Watching 30 seconds from house \r\n45min -1hr from South Point, Green/Black Sand Beach\r\nCons: \r\nNo stores nearby, takes 15 min to drive up the hill\r\nPay for Wifi\r\nTV is Roku, not live \r\nNo AC, But fans in each room and breeze from outside \r\nA lot of mosquitoes in the area.\r\n\r\nOverall, I really liked the house itself but not so much the area. \r\nHowever, it really depends on what kind of vacation you are looking for. \r\n \r\nThank You Cheryl"

The house is really beautiful and is exactly as described and pictured.  Lynn, the manager, was very nice and accommodating. \r\n\r\nBe sure to follow the recommendations from Cheryl and the other reviewers.  Bring your food and drinks with you and be careful in planning your outings so you don't have to go up and down the hill too many times.  I was terrified driving down the hill for the first time (despite the breathtaking views!) b/c I was convinced we'd never get our rental minivan back up the switchbacks on the winding narrow road, but it really wasn't a problem."

The neighborhood is very quiet and the houses set apart. Homolino beach is a short drive and mild walk away, and is very secluded and beautiful.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\nThe property is on a big lava flow area, which is a cool vibe (feels like Mars) but not a lush part of Hawaii. Also, the swim/snorkel area 1.5 blocks away is not a beach (its a rocky lava shore) and not the safest feeling -- Homolino is great though, as are other places you can drive to. Finally, Cheryl openly admits this, but it is really far from stores, restaurants, etc (30-60m depending). Just things to keep in mind."

The location is really unique and amazing. \r\n\r\nIt was in a nice, secluded neighborhood with fairly easy access to local beaches. The south end of the island is a beautiful place to explore, especially if you are looking for a relaxing, quiet vacation away from the traditional touristy Hawaii.\r\n\r\nThe road down to the house was a bit steep and winding, but it's well paved and we didn't have any issues. It does take a bit of time to get in or out of the neighborhood on this road since you have to drive slow.\r\n\r\nCommunication with the host was prompt, friendly, and helpful. Very easy to communicate back and forth with any questions we had during our stay."

Free to use: snorkling gear, washer and dryer, stove, fridge with ice maker... everything works fine. House is located in secluded location right at the ocean. Island itself is amazing: we drove everywhere: Waipio valley (twice!), Waimea, Hapuna beach (nice sand beach), Kahaluu beach (best snorkling beach), Hookena beach, Hilo, Kona, waterfalls,  Volcano park, Mauna Kea. Dolphin tour is must see! Only thing is that house does not have A/C (still have lots of fans in every room), so if  you stay in the house all day it might be little uncomfortable (at least it was for us those 2 days we did not go anywhere), but you won't find A/C in most places anyway.  \r\nIt was the best vacation we have ever had! Thank you! P.S Mangos are delicous in Hawaii! Ate them everyday, never got tired!"

Easy drive from Kona Airport with a quick stop at Target (or Wal-Mart across the highway) for food supplies before driving south to Miloli'i. We always stop at the South Kona Fruit Stand for smoothies before arriving at the Aloha Beach House. Amazing snorkeling in Honomalino Bay (get there early and you'll be treated to hours of entertainment by dolphins with no one else around). Quick drive over to Volcano National Park and super easy to all other attractions the Big Island has to offer. When you return to the Beach House, fire up the grill for dinner and enjoy your delicious Hawaiian meal on the deck. The Beach House is comfortable year-round, even without A/C (we've stayed in March and June). Don't miss the phenomenal sunsets that can be seen from the deck, as well as from inside! "

The house has lots of space, it's very clean, fully equipped with everything and the terrace provides an amazing view over the sea. We loved to snorkel and see an amazing colorful underwater world only 2 min away from the house. We would come back anytime. If you don't look for overcrowded places and beaches we can strongly recommend to stay there for quite and relaxing holidays"

The welcome was warm with Daniel looking after us and showing us the kayaks and beach gear (which we put to good use around the bays near Captain Cook). The design of the house allows for some fantastic sea breezes meaning we didn't over heat and some of the best snorkelling was just down the road in the bay itself! The house is very comfortable and well stocked with dvds and netflix. A very relaxing stay and a definite recommendation!"

The house was well appointed; we had everything we needed and more, with attentive care from both our hosts and from Daniel, who lives next door and was just a phone call away.  The house was surprisingly cool with all the sliding glass doors and fans.  Even after being closed up in the heat, it cooled off quickly upon our return in the evening.  We loved the location, since it was off the beaten path, giving us easy access to explore places that may not be seen by most visitors to the big island.  We loved jumping in the water first thing in the morning.  There is an easy place to hop in and enjoy world class snorkeling just a two minute walk away, and with snorkel gear provided, as well as boogie boards and kayaks, exploration is a must.  We highly recommend this house to anyone looking for a vacation away from the resorts and standard tourist fare.  Although we were two couples, it was obvious the house would be great for kids and adults alike.  Thanks, Cheryl, for making our stay on the big island memorable and relaxing."

We had fun playing games in the basement (having a washing machine on our trip was also a bonus) and settling down to some netflix after a long day's adventures to relax with the screen doors open.\r\nThe swimming area is neat (it is not a beach, but a rocky area you walk down directly to the water and has a home-made bridge and railing to keep your balance) and all the snorkeling equipment is available with the rental!\r\nThe biggest issue with the house is that it is located at the bottom of a large hill/cliff with very, very steep roads. We didn't mind driving a while to the nearby towns (Kona is ~1 hour away) but the road down to the house is pretty rough and at points it's nearly 1 lane wide, which is a little scary when there are also other people trying to get up or down the hill. It also takes about 15-20 minutes to drive up or down it. Yikes!\r\nAll in all, we had a good time at the house. Mahalo!"

Great to have bottled water supplied in the heat of Hawaii! \r\n\r\nThe house is amazing. Spacious, comfy, well equipped. A fantastic holiday home for a couple getting away, a group having an adventure, or a family spending time together. The kind of house you could settle into for a few weeks, and not feel cramped. \r\n\r\nThe location is good in some ways. It is between Kona and the volcano, which means you could explore in either direction. But it wasn't what we were looking for. I should have done more research. \r\n\r\nWe wanted surf, easy swimming, and not a lot of driving. We were only in Hawaii for five days, and wanted some R&R. We couldn't easily access the water from here, and needed to drive to explore. Other reviewers didn't seem to have this problem, and certainly the guest book in the host was full of glowing reviews from people who had a great time and swam nearby very happily. \r\n\r\nWe actually ended up leaving after one night, instead of the booked three. Only because we didn't do enough research before booking, and the location didn't suit us. As I said, the house is great, Cheryl is great, and the location will suit some people really well. Just not us. "

Daniel the neighbor came by to tell us about the best spots to visit in the area. The house (and the whole neighborhood) is on one big lava flow. There is next to no traffic and also next to no lights at night, which made for incredible star gazing. I could spend forever sleeping to the sound of the surf from this house! Honomalino Beach (just a short drive and hike from the house) was the best, most private beach we visited on the Big Island. And the house is stocked with all the beach toys you could need! The game room looked fun, but we were too busy having fun outside to ever use it. Can't wait to go back!"

          "comments": "It is all about the Toilet paper. \r\n\r\nIf you don't read anything else in this review, understand that the toilet paper provided at the Makai Hideaway is really good quality paper, it exemplifies the attention to detail that Cheryl put into her home, and the hospitality in the small details that makes a big difference between just a rental and an amazing home. \r\n-----\r\nWe loved our stay at Cheryl's place! We felt incredibly privileged that she shares her wonderful home. \r\n\r\nFirst, the location: One of the things that the Big Island is known for is its volcanoes and lava. Other than seeing actual flowing lava (which wasn't possible during our stay), one can pretty much experience the same at the seaside house. The house is on actual lava flow and one can see and experience the lava field the community is built upon. In addition, one can see and hear the ocean and the beautiful coastline from the house. There is a small black sand beach less than 20 minutes away as well as another swimming/snorkeling location less than 5 minutes (walking!) away. In short, the location is beautiful!\r\n\r\nHospitality: It is the little things that count: an up-to-date 2014 travel guide for the Big Island that we brought with us on our daily excursions, Hawaiian music CDs, DVDs, wifi, kitchen utensils, bowls and everything else you'd need to cook, laundry room, game room, water fun activity stuff...we really couldn't have asked for anything more during our stay. \r\n\r\nThe process: Cheryl was very responsive to our request to book, even though we contacted her last minute. She is very friendly and answered all of our questions promptly. Her directions were excellent, we had no problem finding the house at night. Daniel the local caretaker is a fount of local information, providing tips on what is worth the time and money and what is just a tourist trap. \r\n\r\nOther miscellaneous thoughts: the house is a ways away from the main tourist area of Kona, which is great because you can enjoy your stay away from tourists. Also, the house is great value to share with some friends as there are plenty of sleeping places. \r\n"

Plenty of space to sit and relax (although we were usually out and about) and the extra goodies (kayaks, snorkeling gear, boogie boards) were so great to have.  Don't worry about bringing snorkel gear as there are about ten full sets.\n\nAs previous reviews suggested, the house is a bit out of the way (roughly an hour south of Kona and fifteen minutes down a winding road of switchbacks).  This was not too big a deal for us since it's the Big Island and we knew we would be doing a lot of driving.\n\nThere are four beds in the house and a few additional sleeping spaces (a futon, air mattress, and sofa bed).  We had 8 adults, and not all were couples, so it was a tad constricting.  One was in the futon and another in the air mattress.  Not too bad for the week we were there, but any additional time might have seemed cramped.\n\nCheryl is great at communication leading up to the trip.  I had several questions and she usually responded within minutes.\n\nDaniel, who watches over the house since Cheryl doesn't live in the area, is a treasure trove of information.  He is very fun and loves to help with any planning.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend the house.  Just make sure it is the right fit for your size group and what you're wanting to do."

We stocked up food at Costco & Choicemart, and ate gourmet meals every night. The lanai is large and comfy, and with fans and the breeze we didn't need AC.  Miloli is in a fairly isolated location, but that also is a positive if you aren't looking for hordes of tourists (we weren't), and it is much closer to the Volcano Park than other places on the Kona side. Cheryl was great to work with and very attentive to our needs. Daniel the host is very welcoming, and so are the other neighbors. The ocean is fabulous there, crashing surf vs.lava.  The house is accommodating and comfy, and cutely decorated. The ping-pong table was well-used by us, as was the kitchen.  The price was very reasonable for everything provided.  Overall, a great week - thanks, Cheryl ! "

There was also lots of water gear which we were grateful to have for our trips to the beach.  We especially enjoyed the spacious lanai where we had all our meals.  The house has a great view of the ocean and we were able to watch wales breaching in the evenings through binoculars provided by Cheryl.  It is a very comfortable house and there is always a nice cooling breeze on the lanai.  "

We liked the place, sunny, close to the ocean (no sandy beach like everywhere on Big Island, but good enough to swim), just 100 meters from rocky steps to the ocean. One thing made us upset - this place is really far from everything and to get there you drive from the highway down along mountain serpentine for 5 miles. For a short stay is not convenient, good for a long relaxing vacation."

We had zero problems.\r\n\r\nThe house itself is great. While there were only four of us on this trip, the house could easily accommodate twice that many. The beds were comfortable, the bathrooms well stocked with shampoo, soap, sunscreen, ointments, etc., and the view of the ocean off the front lanai was excellent.\r\n\r\nThe kitchen is well stocked with everything you need to make good food, and the living area has comfortable furniture and even amenities like Netflix.\r\n\r\nThe caretaker, \"Uncle\" Dan, was friendly and outgoing. He is also a fount of local information, and he gave us directions to an excellent local beach. This beach is hard to get to, but is fantastic.\r\n\r\nThe house also has just about everything you need for an island stay: many pairs of snorkels and flippers, kayaks, body boards, water shoes, and numerous other stuff to make your stay pleasant. The fact that you are a one minute walk from excellent snorkeling in the bay doesn't, hurt, either.\r\n\r\nThe listing is very accurate, and the photos match the house. The house itself is very nicely appointed with nice art and colours. It didn't feel like we were invading anyone's personal space, and it was very comfortable.\r\n\r\nThe only \"drawback\" has more to do with the island itself than the house. It is fairly remote, and it takes a lot of driving to get anywhere. Not that distances as so far: you can only drive about 35 mph / 60 km/h, so it takes a while to get anywhere. The twisty roads take some getting used to, especially for a Canadian who's used to wide open spaces and straight roads. None of this detracts from the house, which was exactly as advertized.\r\n\r\nOverall, the house was what we expected, the hosts were fantastic, and the view of the ocean off the lanai is great. We had an excellent time, and I would recommend this house to anyone who wants to \"get away from it all\" in a secluded location."

We loved spending time in the bright living room surrounded by views of the ocean and on the wrap around balcony. Daniel greeted us and made us feel welcome - he was full of insider knowledge and great tips. \r\n\r\nThe house is at the bottom of a steep and winding road - the drive down from the highway takes 10-15 minutes depending on your comfort. The road is well paved and you do not need a 4 wheel drive.\r\n\r\nEverything you could need for the beach is provided, including snorkel gear and kayaks. Although we didn't have the opportunity to use the kayaks or the snorkel gear because the waves were very rough near the house - I think this is uncommon and was due to a swell passing through. There are 3 good size bedrooms plus a queen bed in the game room. I think the house could comfortably sleep 4 couples plus a couple of children on air mattresses and pull out couches. Note that the game room, bathroom, and large bedroom downstairs are not connected to the main living space upstairs.\r\n\r\nVolcano National Park is about 1 - 1.5 hours away and Hilo can be reached in 2 hours with no traffic, if you really book it (we were late for a flight). Captain Cook is not too far, but the traffic took us nearly an hour. Make sure to bring your own food to the house. All kitchen items are provided.\r\n\r\nWe only wish we could have stayed longer. I think the house is a great place to relax and enjoy the quiet and wonderful view. There are some wonderful hikes nearby and Volcano National Park is not too far. We're hoping to bring our family back."

I think the only description that I either missed or was not there was just the windy roads to mile marker 89 and the 3 miles down to the subdivision. I am very glad we arrived in daylight as the road could have been a  little scary in the dark first time round. Some people may not enjoy those trips daily up/down that road. Might be nice as a heads up for potential guests. Just a thought. The sunsets views as well as the sunrises were incredible. That was spot on. The neighborhood was very quiet and felt really safe there (when we were there). I think the place was fantastic. I sure hope that the new houses going up don't affect the view but really unless it is a high rise the views will still be spectacular. Location was great. Close to Volcano, South Point and  getting to Hilo. It was also great heading back into Kona. Windy roads definitely slow travel down but gets you to look at all the local land. We did not even have to spend money on snorkeling trips as we had enough gear and enough beaches to go do it ourselves. Tons of dolphins within feet of us. Turtles. Many fishes and we believe one small shark! I mean the beauty was everywhere. Just know that the beaches nearby are not your typical sandy white beaches but beautiful in their own special ways. Make a point to eat local kine foods. Markets, fruit/vege stands all over. Fresh fish. Cook at the house....We had a few of our best meals at home and local grown foods. No paid for luau needed. I got to eat poi daily. ONOLICIOUS! Mahalo nui Cheryl for a beautiful comfortable home and the most perfect lanai. Until next time. "

They had everything there you could think of for the stay including water toys, fishing gear, etc.  Saved alot of money from having to rent everything.  I would definitely go back and visit again in the future.  The location was a little out there but that's actually what we preferred, was to be away from all the tourists.   But overall it is in a great spot because you can venture around the island in either direction and see it all.  Thanks again for the amazing experience!"

The house was great! The location is ideal for vacation escapes. The house is quiet, clean and comfortable. We found everything we needed. There are tons of travelling books and brochures about Big Island. We played ping pong and air hockey while waiting for laundry. Dan was very informative. He told us where to buy local food and where to find a quiet beach. We had a lot of fun! We wish we could stay longer!"

This house is amazing and it's kinda surreal being surrounded by the black lava flows but also totally wonderful experience.  We all thoroughly enjoyed the comfort of the house and there were lots of extras in the property which made it homely and also came in very useful (kayak & snorkeling gear).  It is off the main road near the ocean so it feels very calm at night, good if you are just wanting to get away from it all.  It also makes perfect viewing for starts at night.  During the day you can take advantage of being a short drive to the volcano national park, the black or green sand beaches or a drive up to Kona or Hilo...of course there is a lot of things in the house so you could just relax there or wander down to the local fishing village and buy some fresh fish.  We did this and had a BBQ on the decking.  It was a nice way to spend our last night.  We were there 4 nights 5 days and will definitely be back...there is still SOOOOO much to do! Thanks Anna , Michael, Damien, Marika, Kerrie and Peter."

We ended up having to rearrange our travel dates and Cheryl did everything she could to help us have a full, pleasant stay. The home itself is large, especially for two people, so we definitely didn't take enough advantage of all the toys and amenities this place has to offer. We really enjoyed the beautiful king bed, the wonderful ocean breeze, the incredible deck, kitchen that was well-stocked with everything needed to cook, and some of the special little private nooks nearby where we could get in some great swims in the ocean. We loved watching the sunsets from the expansive deck and Cheryl really thought of everything one might need to make themselves feel right at home. Thank you for making such a memorable end to our trip! "

Great to have 3 bathrooms. And very convenient to have a fully stocked house with lots of beach gear, an amazing playroom, WIFI, etc. etc.\r\nDaniel was very helpful.\r\nMilolii is in the  least touristy part of the Big Island, which suited as very well. The local beach (Honomolino) is nice, and it's also possible to swim and snorkel very near the house. But good to keep in mind that it's at least a 45 minute drive to any supermarkets, cafes, restaurants, white sand beaches, and golf courses, for people that are looking for a more resort-style Hawaii experience.

So relaxing, beautiful views, a calm quiet neighbourhood. The house is about 20 minutes from town, but it's only an hour from Kona or Volcano National Park which is so convenient. We were a party of two so the place was spacious for us. Could easily accommodate a big family or two couples (basement area feels very separate). Appreciated how well stocked the home was - lawn chairs, snorkel gear, bug spray! Cheryl and Daniel have thought of everything!"

The property is set up as a nice beach house or a lake side cottage for that matter and has enough space to sleep large groups of up to 9.  The house has 3 bathrooms and modern amenities such as WiFi and a lot of beach friendly gear such as fins, snorkeling equipment, body boards, and kayaks.  There is a great DVD collection as well, specially for kids.  Enough has been said about Daniel, the wonderful neighbor and caretaker, in past reviews but I must add that he makes the stay all the more pleasant and comfortable.  He knows the Island very well and will give you valuable advice on activities and excursions among other things.  Cheryl is a great host and promptly responded to all of our inquiries and questions and made sure that we were set up for a great time prior to arrival.  Please note that the nearest supermarkets are near Kona which is a 45 minute drive so when Cheryl tells you to do grocery shopping prior to showing up at the Beach House on the first day, please take that advice.  This is a great location for visiting Volcano National Park but it is a bit of a drive if you want to visit places such as Mauna Key and Hilo so factor that into planning excursions as well.   "

The location is south of Captain Cook, next to Milolii, a good 45 minutes south of Kona providing wonderful views of black lava rock and the ocean!  The house is spacious with large rooms but we kept the widows and doors open to allow air to circulate as it was a hot weekend.  However, keep the screens shut and be sure to use bug repellent as you'll get bitten!  We cooked each night with awesome sunsets and ate out of the deck.  Snorkeling next to the house was convenient with steps into the water.  "

Some dropped out of the trip, but we decided to keep our reservation. We were pleasantly surprised by the amount of gear and the plethora of sizes the home had (kayaks, snorkels, and even water shoes). Sometimes places boast these things and they never fit or there isn't enough for everyone, but for our party of 5 there was plenty. \r\n\r\nCheryl and Daniel were great and made our late arrival very easy. There are plenty of guides and brochures in the home for activities, though everything will take some time to drive to.\r\n\r\nThe kitchen was very nice, though ants can be a problem if you leave anything on the counter. The geckos were cute to all but one in our party who doesn't like lizards.\r\n\r\nWord of warning, my boyfriend and I got eaten alive by some type of bug the first night (not sure when it happened - maybe while eating dinner outside on the patio... these weren't the typical mosquito bites - maybe fleas?), so be sure to apply plenty of bug repellent. We didn't get any more bites after using some, but it made the rest of the trip pretty uncomfortable (they were all over our feet so we couldn't wear proper shoes without discomfort). The others in our party were fine (only a couple of mosquito bites here and there). We didn't tell our hosts until the end of the trip, so there wasn't much they could do, but they said they do spray the home for pests every month. They can't help the location after all (it's a tropical island! We only wish we were better prepared)\r\n\r\nOverall, if you know what you are getting (remote, quiet, private location right on the beach), don't mind not having AC, and wear plenty of bug repellent this place is a great stay.

Upstairs is spacious, the rooms are nice. The patio is lovely, with a great view. The host is very thoughtful in the selection of beach equipment, books, and DVDs which made our trip even more enjoyable. \nThe room downstairs is in a recreation room with a pool and ping pong table. The mattress of the bed is very uncomfortable, and the noise from the water heater is disruptive, meaning one cannot use water at night. It was very hard to cool off the room, especially at night since the fans will only run if the lights are on. \nWe did have a great stay, a few tweaks could make this place even better. "

          "comments": "\"BEST PLACE TO STAY ON THE BIG ISLAND\"  Our family loved Cheryl's place. What a gracious person she is to share her home. It's not often that a place is better than you expect, but this time it was. We love the South Kona area, warm days, cool nights, ocean breeze, stars fill the night sky, watch wales from the deck, waves splashing on the lava, very few bugs and the ones that were there got zapped by the largest bug zapper we have every seen. And best sunsets ever, first night we saw the Green Splash! Walk or hike the area and Daniel will tell you how to get to a very private black sand beach and some other places to visit, such as Hookena  Beach Park, only a short drive. Wish we had gone there our first day, as we waited our last day to visit this beach and still got to swim with the Dolphins. WOW! If you decide to go to this beach, go early as the parking fills up fast.  So spend some time talking with Daniel, you will be glad you did and he is a great guy and our new friend. We spent two weeks at Cheryl's home and could have spent two more. Everything you need and more is at this house. Next time we are going to make it three weeks. Mahalo Cheryl. Aloha, Gary & Dee & Family (February 2017) Hey guys, this was my Valentine's Gift to my Wife. Happy Wife, Happy Life! Aloha "

Nicely located between kona and volcanoes natl pk for easy access to both locations. Would love to return! Cheryl really took the time to answer all emails in a very short amount of time. Daniel, the house manager, was full of knowledge and gave great recommendations. My recommendation, stay longer than you think you want. You won't regret it!"

From the neighbour you get a very worthful \"check-in\" with lots of special touristic informations. He is very helpful during the whole stay (thank you). Snorkeling and swimming is nice over there if your are careful during in/out procedure. Never face the ocean your backside and try to find out if the waves are in the right height.\nThe black volvano ash surrounding is typicall for a new building area like this. To reach the house a car is necessary and its always a long and steep drive back home.   \nThank you Cheryl for everyhing.\nGood bye Gabriele+Jo+Jan Fahlke"

We stayed there for a few nights and were out of the house for the majority of the day exploring the island, but coming back to the house at night was always great. Perfect location to watch sunset and the water. Mosquitos can be a bit intense outside, but with some spraying you will be fine. No complaints since everything was in the house and fully furnitured. If we come back we would definitely stay there again! Thank you!"

There is so much to do south of the house, from black sand beach, green sand beech the southern most point in US and Volcano National Park(VNP). The park is up there with the Grand Caynon for me. Cheryl is a great hostess and helped me with the many questions I had before the trip. When you get to the house Daniel is there to help you in any way. Cheryl and Daniel both recommended the night time Manta Ray dive(sorkel) with Hang Loose.  The drive with the rays is an experience I would never forget. "

          "comments": "This was a wonderful house for a Hawaii getaway. The area is not exactly what you'd expect for Hawaiian scenery--it is in a community built on lava rocks--but it is relaxing nonetheless. The house has several high-quality kayaks that are free to use, and is very close to a very scenic cove where is excellent to use them. We spent a full day kayaking to a nearby beach, where we used sand toys that were also provided in the house.\n\nThe only downside for the house is the location: it is quite a ways south of Captain Cook, and the last few miles are down an exceptionally windy road. If you plan to travel in to Captain Cook or Kona every day, then the drive might get a bit tiresome. But you won't find a house that has nearly as good a deal as this anywhere near the cities, so you get what you pay for. For us, the opportunity to rent such a wonderful and large home for such a great rate more than made up for the commute."

As others have mentioned, it is not the white sandy beach resort, but exactly what we were looking for away from that tourist scene. Cheryl has set up the house with all you could need and more. We were very comfortable and it was easy to settle right in and feel at home. Just a side note: If you are in need of a chiropractor, (yes, unfortunately I was) Mark Cohen in Ocean View saved my vacation! We found the drive up and down the hill to the sub division (switch back lane, lol)  an opportunity  for jokes, laughter and a great view. All in all, a great time and super home to hang out and a good base camp for excursions. Thanks Cheryl for sharing your beautiful home !"

If you're concerned with the lack of AC there's nothing better than opening up the sliding doors and letting the cool ocean breeze in. The view from the deck is beautiful, it's the perfect spot to enjoy your morning coffee or a nice homemade breakfast. Daniel was very helpful with planning out our days and the House Manual (the yellow folder) also has great suggestions for more places to explore.\n\nAll in all this house provides you with everything you need to enjoy your days on the Big Island. The rough winding road down may be tricky but definitely worth the drive overlooking a picturesque community atop majestic lava rocks. This home is definitely a rare find and the atmosphere is something everyone should seize the opportunity to experience. We loved our stay and only wish we had a few days more to enjoy it!!"

We took the kayaks and the snorkeling gear to the near by beach and had a blast. If you are looking to have some fun, adventure, or even some peace and quiet look no further this is the spot. Also throughout the whole process cheryl and Daniel were easily accessible and always available for communication. Can\u2019t say enough good things about our experience, looking forward to hopefully visiting again someday soon."

We didn't have the luck with the weather, so we missed out on the night skies and water activities near by, but the house itself was good to relax in. We were initially worried that the house didn't have A/C at the house, however with the ocean breeze cooling down the house, we didn't have much trouble with the temperature. Most importantly, Cheryl is great at responding quickly for all your questions, so reach out to her anytime."

Cheryl was amazing with communication and provided us all the information we needed well in advance so we could plan everything out properly without having to worry about anything at all. \n\nThe place itself is amazing to say the least, you can hear the ocean when you stand at the patio and the sly is so clear that you can see milky way from your bare eyes. There are 3 bedrooms and enough beds in total space to sleep at least 8 adults and two kids if you are a big family or group. \n\nDaniel is great and knows the island in and out, chat with him about the things to do on the island and he will make sure you have a fun time."

It was great to wake up to an ocean view and drinking our coffee on the huge porch was one of our favorite things. The porch is also great for watching the stars, which are amazingly bright because the neighborhood doesn\u2019t have street lights, which we loved! Cheryl has many boogie boards, snorkeling sets, and even water shoes to borrow. We also played some of the board games Cheryl has left. Daniel is absolutely wonderful and taking his advice on beaches and things to do was perfect! Anything we needed he was there for us. My family and I loved the area and are already planning our next trip. The Big Island is now our favorite travel destination we\u2019ve been to!"

It easily accommodated our group of 10 and afforded enough privacy.\n\nPre-arrival communication was responsive and the check in and check out processes were entirely hassle free. Daniel, the local point of contact, was a very engaging and knowledgeable resource. There was a pamphlet with lots of pearls about local sights and amenities and Daniel was readily available for any questions or clarifications that came up.\n\nThe place was clean and very well furnished and there were plenty of linens. The kitchen was well appointed and all of the appliances were functioning. We enjoyed the panoramic view from the deck morning, noon and night. It was a perfect place to get away from it all, yet just a 30 minute drive to several of the most iconic sights on the Island.\n\nRecommend without reservation; you will love your stay."

Cheryl has a beautiful house in a great location. We were 7 adults celebrating my daughter\u2019s college graduation and our 32nd anniversary in May 2018. After we planned the trip, Kilaueua erupted and that made us even more excited to visit. Unfortunately, it also meant vog on our side of the island, eliminating the Fantastic Sunsets part of the equation. But it also meant less direct sun, so much cooler. Cheryl\u2019s house is ideal if you want to get away from the madding crowd, but have access to all the Big Island has to offer. We were out of the house every day by 7am and back in time to make dinner and enjoy each other\u2019s company. Our itinerary included Honomalino Beach, South Point, Discovery Harbor, Green Sand Beach, Punalu'u Black Sand Beach, Hilo, Rainbow Falls, Mauna Kea, Makalawena Beach, Kahalu\u2019u Beach Park, Kealakekua Bay (visit Ehu & Kai Adventures for rentals \u2013 family-owned!), Captain Cook monument, and the City of Refuge - Pu'uhonua O H\u014dnaunau National Historical Park. All with Miloli\u2019I as our home base. It IS 10 minutes off the hwy down a winding road with a 1500-foot drop in elevation, but that\u2019s a good thing to me! There was nothing we needed that wasn\u2019t already in the house, except food, but including spices. The property description is excellent; the house is exactly as described. One thing that I didn\u2019t pick up on is that the water cistern isn\u2019t for drinking water \u2013 Cheryl provides that in a couple of water cooler/dispensers with plenty of extra jugs of water. But water became our only problem \u2013 more below. Thought we would use the ping pong & pool tables, but no time \u2013 we were never in the house. Never turned the TVs on either. The house did get hot after being locked up all day, but it cooled off fast with so many windows and screen doors and fans. Costco IS a sensible first stop before coming to the house. We planned out our meals and got most all the ingredients there. We ended up with too much food though, and took most of the excess over to Pahoa to donate to the Leilani Estates evacuation center. Funny though; we didn\u2019t seem to have an excess of alcohol.  But as with most marvelous properties, everything\u2019s great as long as everything\u2019s great. But what happens when something happens? I think that\u2019s when you find out what kind of host you have. For us, it came on the 7th day- no water came out of the faucets. We let Cheryl & Daniel know, and they immediately went to work trying to find the problem. It turned out we were out of water, which was a little odd since we were fairly conservative on water use and the house has a big tank. But Daniel..."

Location is a bit off the beaten path, but it\u2019s much closer to Volcano National Park than Kona and about equidistant to Hilo as Kona is.  Definitely fly into Kona if staying here, but if flying into Hilo be sure to take the southern route by Volcano National Park.  Finally, working with Cheryl is effortless, and the host Daniel is friendly and helpful.  Take Cheryl\u2019s advice and be sure to shop on your way in for necessities.  Closest town with services is about 30 minutes away.  House had everything we could\u2019ve asked for so only pick up food, drinks, etc.  All other amenities are provided."

The house is very stylish with full amenities.\nI got up at 5:30 am and jogging around the village, street by street in the curvy and hilly roads, about 7 KM in total, which was very beautiful!\nDaniel is very friendly and helpful, he will tell you many secret places where the local goes. Just standing at the beach, you could see dolphins jumping!\nAll my families enjoyed a lot, and will definitely come  again when we travel to the Big Island next time!\n\nThank you Cheryl and Daniel!\n\nYiran"

          "comments": "Everything went well. We stayed there for two days for an event down at Milolii. The whole house was already opened for us upon arrival and I had to sign a form that Daniel brought personally to the home. There were no sponges to wash dishes but was addressed by owner quickly and the manager Daniel brought them by. Upon arrival the house was extremely hot, like an oven with only 2 fans for the 14 people upstairs and downstairs. By the next morning the house cooled down much and was fine for the rest of our stay. Would recommend adding fans for every room in the future. The water was not drinkable due to the machines spitting out white particles even when we changed bottles so we were lucky we brought our own as this house is on catchment. The house was nicely decorated and very beautiful and mostly clean. It had EVERYTHING we needed from paper plates to fresh coffee and creamer and lots of dishes, dishwasher, towels etc which was a great touch. There was even a cute disco ball, pool table in the living room.  Daniel was kind of strange but didn\u2019t bother us besides check in and we were thankful to Cheryl for her accommodating such a large group and think she really puts thought and time into her airBnB even though she is in the mainland. There is a cliff-ocean view and beautiful starry skies but the beach is a small drive away. All in all we would stay here again and thought the overall experience was great for the reason we stayed."

It was spacious and clean and offered great amenities for the kids to play as well as what you would need to take to the beach  The morning view was my favorite, very relaxing and beautiful. The kids loved the adventures to the water and discovering hidden gems.  The community has a speed limit of 15 mph with very little traffic so the kids were able to walk and play carefree outside.  This made my 6th trip to Hawaii (first to Kona) and it was simply wonderful. The house is on the south end of the island which is good in regards to proximity to beautiful beaches that are not crowded, including the one by the house past the village (just be prepared for a bit of a hike but it is well worth it when you arrive)  My kids and I managed to make it to 5 different beaches (1 of them 2 x) Our favorite was Punalu'u Black sand beach (sea turtles).  If you want to relax or hike or have an adventure Cheryl's house puts you in the right place to do so."

It was a few minute walk to the ocean, but not necessarily the beach you would consider safe to swim in.  The coast is a cliff made of lava rock and a rope to pull yourself up/down to.  During the times we walked in the morning and evening (in February) the waves were crashing strongly into that coast line so we refrained from getting in.  The home is has a lot of amenities and activities for young families with kids (games, snorkel equipment, movies, etc).  Unfortunately for our stay, the place didn\u2019t appear to be cleaned properly.  With proper cleaning, the place would be charming and perfect for families looking for a quiet place with a view."

The room was clean, small but it's very hard to find a big room in Hong Kong. The apartment situation is very convenient, near shops, 7/11, restaurants, subway,... I recommend to stay there!\r\n I am an agent in Hongkong who help some travel to reservate apartment ,the above review is wrote by that apartment guest"

Location was very nice. Would definitely want to stay in the same area next time in town. Much nicer than staying on the Hong King island in my opinion with lots of markets and nice bars and cafe's right down the street. And also, Kwan was very helpful meeting us at the metro station and taking us to the flat. Make sure to install (Hidden by Airbnb) before you go!"

Nice common swimming pool. The neighborhood was even nicer than expected. Right next to the Jardim Botanico, many restaurants in this street and in the Rua Pacheco Leao. The Zona Sul, an upmarket supermarket indeed around the corner (corner Rua Jardim Botanico and Rua Pacheco Leao). We very much liked La Biciclette for breakfast, it is a French bakery on the corner of Rua Pacheco Leao and Rua Von Martius. Also we liked the restaurant SOBE in the Rua Pacheco Leao. Good starters, great view on the Christ as it is partly an open-air restaurant. Roberta and her sister were very nice for us."

The apartment is cute and stocked with everything you need to actually live in it, which I appreciated - good kitchen. Roberta was responsive and accessible. If you're visiting Rio, it's a great base, in a lovely neighbourhood. Two things to keep in mind - it's really quite a small space (standard for Rio, but perhaps a surprise for guests who arrive from outside Brazil) and you hear a lot of street noise, so it's perhaps not ideal for light sleepers. We would stay here again!"

The Wonderful City of Rio has so much to offer as I have learned from my own experience, from the traditional Samba during Carnival to the less-known Parque das Ruinas in Santa Teresa (all close by the apartment). We never stop living and learning, and whatever you are planning on doing in Rio de Janeiro, you will continue on this path with an open mind in Rio, and add an important chapter to your personal travel memoire, just by absorbing a few of the experiences Rio has on offer. I have travelled most of the world, and still come alive to the sounds of the different rhythms, love the extraordinary food, and the warmth of the local \"cariocas\". I would say my favorite film so far this year is Intouchables. The apartments that I have to offer are fully equipped, well located, and I will personally make sure you enjoy your stay, without invading your space. I live close by, and can be reached almost any time of day or night.\r\n\r\nI look forward to meeting you!\r\n\r\nCarpe Diem\r\n\r\nSou Ingl\u00eas, mais moro no Rio ha 20 anos, tenho dois filhos quem nasceram aqui (agora eles est\u00e3o estudando fora), e trabalho no mercado financeiro. Acredito nessa cidade maravilhosa e as oportunidades que oferece no futuro - como certamente me passou nas ultimas duas d\u00e9cadas. A gente vive aprendendo, e para qualquer um de voc\u00eas planejando visitar Rio de Janeiro, eu diria para ficar com mente aberta, e voc\u00ea vai crescer como uma pessoa, absorvendo s\u00f3 um pouco da experi\u00eancia Rio tem para lhe provar. J\u00e1 viajei o mundo, e adoro o som dos ritmos diferentes, comida extraordin\u00e1ria e povo t\u00e3o caloroso. Meu filme favorito no momento e os Intoc\u00e1veis. Os apartamentos que tenho para lhe oferecer s\u00e3o bem equipados, localizados, e eu cuido da sua visita pessoalmente, sem invadir seu espa\u00e7o. Qualquer ajuda, s\u00f3 preciso me ligar - moro bem perto.\r\n\r\nCarpe Diem\r\n",

She's a very pleasant host and was quick to communicate with us whenever we had questions during our stay. I would absolutely book here again! Thank you, Molly!"

My parents returned from New York raving about Michelle, her graciousness and her beautiful home including a private outside patio! The apartment was attractively decorated and very clean with all the key amenities including coffeemaker, TV, internet, and even fresh fruit! The supermarket was conveniently around the corner, and my dad said he chatted with locals as he walked to the bakery to get bread each morning. My parents said it was like home away from home. They highly recommend Michelle as a host, and I can't wait to visit myself. Michelle, thank you for making my parents' New York trip so special. You and your family are welcome to visit us in Long Beach, CA anytime. \r\n\r\nMichelle, ist eine wunderbare und nette Gastgeberin.\r\nBei fragen und Tipps stets zur stelle und unglaublich hilfsbereit.\r\nDas Appartement ist sehr ger\u00e4umig und voll ausgestattet.\r\nDie Lage ist erstklassig, U-Bahn und Supermarkt nicht mehr als 150 Meter entfernt.\r\nWir habe uns sehr wohl gef\u00fchlt und k\u00f6nnen uns nicht beklagen. Es ist jedem zu empfehlen der New York als Stadt erkunden will.\r\nJederzeit wieder!!\r\n"

Clean and nicely furnished with a good wide bed in one room and a sofa in kitchen, with all necessary dishes and coffee machine (Michelle even provided us with coffee for it) That was much more than enough for two persons. Also we used bbq in the court which also was great. Michelle was hospitable enough to meet us in the middle of the night!  We didn`t have any problems at all living in such kind of apartment. Should notice that the connection to Mahattan is a little complicated given the G metro line which is not very frequent. But in general the enviroment is quite ok with nice dominican dely on the corner of the street (highly recomended!) "

There are also buses that take you in no time to down town Brooklyn and Williamsburg. Supermarket is around the corner. Bakery for great breakfasts and deliciuos donuts place at 2 minutes walk from home.\r\nThe back garden is also very nice, we were too busy walking all day long, but it gave us a sense of big space, on a nice day you could spend time outside and enjoy a private corner of open air.\r\nIf I have the chance to go to New York again, I will surely go back to Michelle!"

Appartamento con ingresso indipendente, pulito, ben tenuto e con tutto il necessario per 4 persone. I letti sono veramente comodi (non si trovano facilmente nelle case per vacanze). Vicinissimo alla metropolitana, si raggiunge Manhattan in poco tempo, e vicino ad alcuni market, per cui fare la spesa \u00e8 stato facile. La zona \u00e8 abbastanza tranquilla, si rientrava anche a sera tardi ma non abbiamo avuto nessun problema. Michelle \u00e8 una persona molto simpatica, molto disponibile e molto discreta. consiglierei sicuramente di passare una vacanza nel suo appartamento.

My parents slept on the bed and I slept on the couch. I am 180 cm (5' 11'') and fit on the couch and it was pretty comfortable.\r\nWhen we arrived Michelle's house she greeted us right away, took her time to explain how to commute, where to eat and what to do in the city. \r\nThe location of house is pretty good. It takes 20-30 min with metro to Manhattan downtown, depends on which line you use. You can also take the metro from JFK, otherwise the cab costs  around $50. In the house everything was clean and neat. She also provided us towels for shower etc. Besides that, whenever I texted to Michelle she responded in timely manner, which made everything easier.\r\nHonestly, our overall experience was much better than I expected.  Me and my family had a very good time in Michelle's house and NY. If one day I go back to NY, I know where I should stay. \r\n"

Her service is much better than anything you would get at a hotel for a much better price. She gave us a recommendation on where to get breakfast that turned out great. The place is very clean and neatly decorated. It's literally right off the subway station, so that's a huge plus. We also met her mother, who is a fascinating woman. I highly recommend her place, if you are looking to visit the area.  \r\n-- Later Edit:\r\nI should mention that her internet is very fast. I don't know what ISP she uses, but it was a joy to go back to a temporary accommodation and know that you are well connected while traveling. I'm not sure of the exact setup, but it appeared that we had a separate modem and router just for us. This was a huge relief. Michelle had the SSID and password printed and ready for guests, so even if you forget to ask, you would still find them in the apartment. Overall, things were very well thought out before hand and Michelle was very proactive with tiny details like this that make all the difference. This was very surprising to me knowing that I'm dealing with an individual and not a company.   "

The apartment is amazing, plenty of room with all the comforts you could ask for (small kitchen/TV with cable/wifi). Easy access to trains and transportation, with many restaurants near by.

La proximit\u00e9 avec une station de m\u00e9tro est un plus ainsi que celle de l'\u00e9picerie permettant de faire les petites courses pour les repas pris au gite. Michelle est extr\u00eamement accueillante et serviable. \r\nl'appartement est simple et tr\u00e8s propres. 4 vrai lits confortables. \r\n==)n\u00e9gatifs:\r\nbien que situ\u00e9 dans un quartier + calme, la chambre donne sur la rue, et les nuits peuvent \u00eatre difficiles pour les oreilles sensibles. le m\u00e9tro qui passe dessous est audible, tout comme les avions. mais \u00e0 New York , il est difficile de trouver une endroit tr\u00e8s calme. NEW YORK reste un environnement urbain et donc globalement bruyant, autant en avoir conscience. \r\nPour une famille de 4, les lits enfants sont dans la pi\u00e8ce qui sert de coin jour. Une table et chaises pliantes n\u00e9cessitent d'\u00eatre pli\u00e9s  pour installer le 4i\u00e8me lit et inversement, plier le lit pour prendre les repas. Pour les fran\u00e7ais que nous sommes, la table est aussi importante que le lit. \u00e7a peut \u00eatre un probl\u00e8me. \r\nPeu de vaisselle ( verres en plastique) ce qui est un peu dommage mais \u00e7a reste un d\u00e9tail.\r\nMais quand on vient \u00e0 New York, ce n'est pas pour une ballade gastronomique. Nous recommandons vraiment cette adresse. Tr\u00e8s bon compromis.\r\nLa cours arri\u00e8re sera appr\u00e9ciable pour les p\u00e9riodes + douces.\r\n\r\nEnglish comments:\r\nJust returned from NYC where we stayed with our 2 teenagers in Michelle's appartement. We are really delighted .\r\n\r\n==)positives:\r\nGood compromise quality / price ratio . Proximity to a metro station is a must as well as with the grocery store allowing some errands for meals at the appartement. really practical, opened until 21h. Michelle is extremely friendly and helpful.\r\nthe appartment is simple but  very clean with 4 real comfortable beds.\r\n\r\n==)negatives:\r\nAlthough located in a quiet neighborhood, the parent room is overlooking the street, and the nights can be difficult for sensitive ears. Subway is audible,as well as cars & trucks in the street. But to moderate this aspect,  in New York, it's difficult to find a quiet place because it remains a generally noisy urban environment as knowledge.\r\nFor a family of 4, children beds are in the main room. A table and chairs need to be folded to open beds and vice versa, folding bed for meals. it could be a problem.\r\nVery few dishes ( plastic glasses ) which could be improved but it's still a detail.\r\n\r\nBut when we come to visit New York, it is not for gastronomic ballad, and it's important  to find a confortable & clean area. The backyard could be pleasant when the weather allows to use it. Unfortunatelly for us it's was too cold begining of march.\r\nWe really recommend this address.\r\nMany thanks to Michelle.\r\n\r\nPascale et Yann."

The suite was very clean, attractive and inviting. There are not many places to eat or shop in this neighbourhood which makes the proximity of the subway such a plus. It's only 1/2 block away!

Bring towels and sheets is not usefull she provides it and it is really great especially when you're coming from far away.\r\nThe garden is nice and allows friendly barbecue evenings and breakfasts. \r\nAs often in the USA, the room has no shutter and the walls are thin so for those who need silence and darkness to sleep I will advice to take a sleeping mask and earplugs, but the accommodation is located in Brooklyn, the environment is much less noisy than Manhattan. \r\nWe stayed for 4 nights and were very satisfied with the accommodation.

Lejligheden var ren og p\u00e6n, med alle de ting en familie har brug for. Godt lille k\u00f8kken, hvor vi hver dag kunne lave morgenmad, kaffe og te. Dertil en rigtig hyggelig g\u00e5rdhave, hvor man kan slappe af efter en hektisk dag p\u00e5 Manhattan. Kvarteret hvor lejligheden ligger i er et beboelseskvarter, med masser af butikker, restauranter, skoler og kirker. Et levende omr\u00e5de, men meget trygt og vi f\u00f8lte os meget sikre n\u00e5r vi gik rundt. Vi var glade for, at vi valgte at bo i Brooklyn, for der er meget at se og opleve i omr\u00e5det. Michelles lejlighed ligger kun 30 meter fra en subway, og det er enkelt at finde til Manhattan eller andre steder p\u00e5 Brooklyn. Vores fly var forsinket, og vi ankom f\u00f8rst kl. 01 til lejligheden, men Michelle var meget omt\u00e6nksom og havde lagt vand og juice i k\u00f8leskabet, og s\u00f8rget for at der var kaffe. S\u00e5 kunne vi lige klare os til n\u00e6ste morgen, hvor vi handlede ind i supermarkedet - tak for det Michelle.\r\n\r\nI det hele taget gjorde Michelle det nemt at v\u00e6re turist i New York. Hun var tilg\u00e6ngelig for vores sp\u00f8rgsm\u00e5l og da vi skulle hjem, bestilte hun en taxa til os. Lejligheden, omr\u00e5det og Michelle gav vores efter\u00e5rsferie til en s\u00e6rlig oplevelse for os alle fem, og vi vil varmt anbefale andre at bo hos Michelle."

That being said, DO NOT turn the water just to hot to wash your hands, you will get burnt. Our flight got in late at night and when we arrived, it smelled like a bug bomb was let off in the apartment. We aired it out every day and it took almost 3 days for the odor to dissipate. Michelle said it was cleaners, I am still unsure. My wife and I both got a headache from the fumes the first night.  The bed in the photo is a misrepresentation, the mattress was a sleep number set to the hardest setting with no remote to adjust it, we slept on the couch/daybed. The pillows were cheap and nearly unusable, bring your own. The sheets were also cheap, hospital quality. There are 14 signs in the apartment and on the door to the back telling you what you are and aren't allowed to do. We had to call to have the heat turned on when it was about 40 degrees in the space and then the radiators are quite noisy and right near the bed.\r\n\r\n45 minute commute on the subway to get to mid-town Manhattan. I would not stay there again, we never felt really comfortable. "

Me gusto muchisimo el apartamento y es cierto lo que dicen algunos comentarios anteriores: el lugar es mucho mas lindo en la vida real que en fotos! Es muy limpio, bonito, espacioso y full equipado con todo ( inlcuso secador de  pelo, spray de cabello, toallas, platos, cubiertos, libros, dos televisores LCD, guias de NYC, un jardin hermoso, TODO!) se tiene privacidad y el vecindario es muy bonito, aunque recomiendo tener cuidado y no llegar a media noche para prevenir cualquier incidente, ya que un taxista nos dijo que a media noche podr\u00faa no ser tan seguro) \r\nEl Subway esta en la esquina de la cuadra y  toma media hora para llegar a Lower Manhattan y 40 minutos a el Midtown, ademas el precio me parece justo. Por otro lado, aunque no conoc\u00ed a Michelle en persona es muy amable, atenta, responde muy rapido por msjs de texto y da recomendaciones si las pides. YO LO SUPER RECOMIENDO y VOLVERIA!!\r\nLo \u00fanico que le sugerir\u00eda a Michelle es dar el numero del apartamento a su pr\u00f3ximo hu\u00e9sped para que sepa llegar exactamente al lugar."

It's also very quite during night time which we enjoyed very much. The subway station is very close by and it is easy to catch a connecting train to Manhattan. \r\nMichelle is a great host. She provides you with the information you need. She gives information on near by supermarkets and other useful hints.\r\nAll in all we had a good time in her apartment and would definitely come back here again."

She had stocked the fridge with essentials like juice, eggs, butter and jam, and the cupboards also had a lot of basics like tea, coffee, pasta etc. Likewise there was plenty of soap, toilet paper, shampoo and body wash in the bathroom, none of which we had ever seen in previous Air BnB apartments. Little touches like this really make a difference if you've ever forgotten your own, or if you don't have a lot of time to spend shopping.\n\nFor a couple, the apartment is spacious, warm, comfortable and extremely close to a subway station with supermarkets and delicatessens in easy walking distance. It's very easy to get into Manhattan within about 40 minutes.\n\nMichelle was extremely accommodating, had lots of good tips about the local area and the rest of NYC, and the next time we are in NYC, I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. It definitely felt like our home away from home in New York! Thanks, Michelle - we really enjoyed our stay with you :0)"

She welcomed my family and explained everything thoroughly - all the amenities, how the heating works, street parking rules and what is to be found in the neighbourhood. \r\nThe unit itself is cozy and beautifully decorated. Main bed is comfortable and sofa bed with pull out trundle is also comfy. Michelle also has a baby's portable cot so the unit can easily accommodate 2 adults and 2 small children. \r\nHeating is great which is important in the brutal NY winter. \r\nKitchen amenities are also good if you want to prepare your own meals. Kitchen is fully equipped with fridge, cooktop, microwave, coffee maker, kettle, pots and pans etc. Closest supermarket is a couple of minutes walk away. It is small but stocks a great variety of produce and organic food options (good for us vegans). \r\nNeighbourhood feels safe enough and not noisy. Subway is also a minute away and the train ride to Manhattan takes roughly 15-20 minutes with a change of trains. \r\nOther things to mention: shower is nice - good stream; good wi-fi; cable tv; glass doors to separate bedroom from living area;  which contains the pull-out sofa; well baby-proofed. \r\nOverall, no complaints. We are very happy customers and highly recommend Michelle and her lovely unit. Would happily stay here again. Thank you Michelle x"

The apartment was toasty once we arrived, and set up just like the photos. Extremely clean and well stocked. I stayed with three friends for 6 nights and though the apartment is small in square footage, it is very spacious because of the way the apartment is set. We were able to have the table with the four chairs up the whole time we were there and managed to move around freely. We definitely took advantage of the kitchen, we cooked every morning. The apartment is located half a block down from the G line which was great since we took the train everywhere. She gave us a list of recommendations, make sure you go to the Black Swan. They have great food and beers. The apartment has central heating so make sure to take a tank top because it is warm at night. We all overpacked because we thought the apartment might of been too cold because of the snow but it was nice and toasty. We did see snow fall down and it was nice to have the patio in the back to make snow angels. Michelle is extremely attentive and if you really want to enjoy New York, stay out in Brooklyn. Definitely give this place a chance, it's worth it. "

Yes, there are signs with rules but nothing outside of common courtesy/sense. There was also a list of nearby supermarkets, attractions, etc. The kitchen was fully equipped, we just didn't take advantage.

She always responded immediately and with really useful information about things like location and weather.\nGetting to the apartment from JFK by train and subway was straightforward and took about an hour and a quarter. It's literally a couple of minutes to the apartment from the station. \nAs Michelle lives upstairs she was able to welcome us straight away into her very warm and cosy home - greatly appreciated in a freezing cold March. Everything's just as described and all the local information we needed was provided for us. A great coffee shop nearby for breakfast, and one of the best doughnuts we've ever tasted from a bakery!\nAs we were spending most of our time in Manhattan, ease of transport was important. No problem. It only took about half an hour to get downtown.\nSo, all in all a great stay. One small criticism (which we did talk to Michelle about) is the heating. It's an old system and when it's on it was really hot and a bit noisy. Any adjustments Michelle has to make from her part of the house, which she was always happy to do but did mean messaging or phoning. \nThanks Michelle!"

I slept lik a rock. The day bed was of good quality as well. Michelle is friendly and always willing to help you out with information. My granddaughter and i had a great time in NYC and were glad to be in Brooklyn to leave all the hassle and bustle of NYC behind us and be in a quiet and safe area.\r\nWe can recommend Michelle's apartment when you are looking for a place close to everything and yet 'apart' from it.\r\n\r\nAll the best Michelle, I hope life will be good to you.\r\n\r\nHelen and Evelyn"

In the surrounding area there is everything you need: KFC, Donkin` Donuts and a supermarket...Whenever we come to New York together with my family, i will definitely stay there. Thanks Michelle.   "

We had a very nice welcome which started with instructions how to get from the airport to the apartment (metro or taxi). When we arrived early, Michelle was waiting and showed us around the house and garden, explaining the house rules etc. She also had a nice folder with food menu's and things to do in the area.\r\n\r\nLocation and area were great, first of all it's really only a two minute walk to the nearest metro station, which gets you into Manhattan/Times Square within 25 minutes. The rest of the area is very convenient and pretty cool as well. There is a Dunkin Donut on the corner, as well as a KFC for breakfast lunch or dinner. For groceries there is a little supermarket also just around the corner.\r\n\r\nWe actually walked from the apartment to Manhattan over the Brooklyn Bridge, all the way through Brooklyn which we found a great experience. Another great stop from the apartment is Coney Island, also in Brooklyn, which has one of the oldest/longest boardwalks in the country. Great atmosphere and amazing food!\r\n\r\nThe apartment itself was very stylish with a lot of personal touches and Michelle made it feel like a home from home with towels, toilet paper and other pleasant surprises. The kitchen is fully stocked with crockery, pots, pans and cutlery  and there is cable and WiFi! The garden is also great, very private and relaxing if you like to sit outside.\r\n\r\nAll in all we highly recommend this apartment. "

We loved that the subway is only 1/2 a block away from the apartment, making it super easy to explore the city.\r\n\r\nMichelle is very friendly and truly cares about her guests' comfort. As mentioned in other reviews, though it can sometimes get a bit too hot/cold in the apartment, if/when that happened, all we had to do was text Michelle and she would adjust the thermostat as soon as she could.\r\n\r\nMichelle provided plenty of towels & bedding for our 3 week stay. When the batteries were low for the TV remote, all we had to do was mention it and she gave us fresh ones. When we needed scissors, she lent us a pair. Like I said, Michelle is great! We would certainly consider staying here again the next time we go to NYC.\r\n\r\nThanks so much Michelle!\r\n\r\n"

Its not a chrome IKEA  kind of place, but a place that was lovingly restored and maintained by Michelle, with everything looking very nice and feels like returning home.\r\nA major advantage, get out of the apartment take a left and 300 feet later you are riding the G subway to Manhattan.\r\nMajor disadvantage, less then half a mile away a great doughnut  place that will add some pounds on your waist.... \r\nAll basic facilities are nearby, grocery, laundromat etc.\r\n\r\nOne thing was missing - don't forget to bring a USB hub or phone chargers, (we forgot to mention to Michelle) otherwise we had a great time and enjoyed very much.

What we enjoyed the most about the apartment was that it worked as a little house where all of us could have our own space and every corner felt like home. It was clear to us that Michelle takes good care of the place in a personal way and that makes it very cozy.\nAs a host, Michelle was kind, clear, organised, helpful and flexible, and payed attention to our needs along all our stay.\nThe neighbourhood was safe, well connected (the G subway line takes you everywhere in Brooklyn and makes it easy to go to Manhattan; there are two stations less than 100 meters away) and has small shops, restaurants and supermarkets. \nWe loved Brooklyn and strongly recommend visitors to take the time to see it. It has a lot to offer and let you have a rest from crowded Manhattan.\nMichelle's apartment was not only a place to have a good night sleep, but also a place where we enjoyed spending time. We would definitely come back!"

She has been a great host, easy to reach and very responsive (she lives upstairs).  At the time of departure she was there as well and allowed me to leave my luggage in her hall so that I could freely enjoy my last hours in town before my late flight at JFK.\r\nThe appartment is cosy and well furnished.  It isn't very big (hey, this is NYC) but 4 guests are at ease and there is a garden (with table, chairs, arbor,...) which doubles the available surface!\r\nThree drawbacks, though:\r\n- there is no microwave anymore in the kitchen;\r\n- there is no window nor ventilation in the bathroom, thus the towels never really dry if left there;\r\n- the master bed is in the frontroom of the house (read next).\r\nThe house is located in a 2 lanes avenue, which means that it is quite noisy due to cars (sometimes with loud music), trucks, buses and even the subway running beneath.\r\nBut the location is perfect if you need access to public transportation, as there is an entrance to the subway at each end of the block as well as a couple of bus lines : travel to Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens and even JFK is easy.\r\nThere are several restaurants, supermarkets, delis, laundries, banks... and the neighborhood is safe.\r\nOverall, it's a great urban spot with an excellent host !"

Since first time we reached her to make our reservation (10 months before our trip) she was always disposed to answer any doubts and questions right away. \r\nWe stayed 14 days in between july and august. The department is exactly like is shown in pictures, its perfect for three, its clean and it has all you may need. And besides it has a big beautiful backyard, which is a bonus (it was our special place where we'd sit at the end of the day, after longs days of walk and drink some beer). \r\nThe neighborhood is nice and safe and there are plenty groceries nearby where you can buy food or any stuff you need. Plus, you have the G subway line just in the corner, thats unbeatable. \r\nThank you for everything, Michelle, hope come back soon!\r\nIvan, Sofia & Marina\r\n\r\n"

Die Unterkunft von Michelle ist wirklich super s\u00fc\u00df eingerichtet, sehr detailreich und sie hat an viele Kleinigkeiten gedacht (wir kamen z.B. abends an, sodass sie uns f\u00fcr den kommenden Tag Getr\u00e4nke und Bagels bereitstellte). Es fehlte an nichts in dem Apartment, sie war jederzeit erreichbar, wenn wir eine Frage hatten und super nett und hilfsbereit. Einziges kleines Manko ist die laute Ubahn, die man vor allem nachts unter der Wohnung fahren h\u00f6rt, aber wir hatten damit nicht so ein gro\u00dfes Problem. Im Gegenteil: die gute Anbindung hat uns sehr viel Zeit gespart und wir konnten alles extrem gut und recht schnell erreichen (Metro ist nur 2Min zu Fu\u00df entfernt von dem Apartment). Wir entschieden uns f\u00fcr Brooklyn, weil wir Manhattan schlichtweg nicht bezahlen \"wollten\", aber auch Brooklyn hat seinen eigenen Charme, den wir extrem cool fanden! Wer also eine Unterkunft sucht, die von der Lage her gut, sehr sauber ist und Wert auf einen netten Gastgeber legt, ist bei Michelle genau richtig aufgehoben! Sehr zu empfehlen. "

          "comments": "Well equipped, clean apartment hosted by the lovely Michelle, who responded quickly whenever we had questions for her, with the intention to help out as well as possible. Definitely a great addition to the Airbnb community.\n\nThe apartment is situated near a subway station in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighbourhood, of which it does become apparent quickly enough that it has had a rocky past, but me and my girlfriend haven't felt unsafe for a single second.\n\nSome practical things that could be handy to know...\n\n* If you're used to silence when you go to sleep, you may experience some difficulties here. We haven't heard any construction going on during our week in New York City, but traffic does go on until pretty late, and you'll hear it a bit when a subway train is passing by. Luckily the ear plugs Michelle has provided help well, and the bed is very comfortable.\n\n* Unrelated to the apartment, but still something I'd like to share for possible future guests to keep into consideration; Brooklyn doesn't have an awful lot of Walmart like supermarkets. There are plenty of delis, but those usually don't have a wide array of products, especially when you prefer to eat healthy. So you'll basically have to be in Manhattan for the higher end supermarkets, and those tend to be very pricey, and you're more or less scr*wed if you're a vegetarian/vegan. Guess you'll have to visit specialty shops for that.\n\n* When it's warm enough, do use that garden. :)"

Michelle helped us, shared information and her generosity shows all over.\nWe were invited to use food that waited for us in the fridge and in the kitchen. Plenty of towels, blankets and all the other stuff. All our requests were fully filled with a big smile.\nThe name of the apparent is correctly describing: great transportation- a two minute walk to the subway station and the garden which adds space, blue sky and the possibility to relax, eat or just stay in and out at the same time."

The apartment was very spacious, clean, nicely decorated and had everything that we needed. She was very easy to communicate with, and very accommodating to our schedule and our needs. When I texted, she responded very quickly. We had plenty of room to spread out for a few days and each had privacy when we needed it. We cooked one night and appreciated that she had the pots and dishes that we needed. She really had everything that we could have needed during our stay. The location is very convenient. It is just a half a block from the G train. We got takeout from a few of the local restaurants nearby. My daughter is a student at Pratt and it was about a 15 minute walk from the campus (Dough Donuts was on the way) :) I even had to make a quick trip to Home Depot and it was a short 2 block walk away. Michelle is a lovely person and I really enjoyed chatting with her. I would definitely stay at Michelle's place again next time we are in Brooklyn!"

We did not get to use the outside space/backyard because it was cold, but it's a lovely space with sitting areas and grill. Michelle anticipated all our needs. The place was fully stocked with all necessities. The location was within walking distance to train and bus. Average trip was 23 minutes. traveled all over NYC from lower to upper Manhattan and no trip was more than 40 minutes. I'll advice you to get an unlimited pass depending on your length of stay. Michelle is such an awesome human being. She made us feel at home from day one. She responded to our email quickly. She was always there when needed for anything. Frankly, we didn't need to bother her at all if we took the time to look. Lol. Like I said earlier, she anticipated all our needs. Thank you so much Michelle for hosting our vacation week!"

Dichtbij de metro. Voor je het weet zit je in Manhattan. Ik vond het erg prettig om buiten Manhattan te zitten. Zo zie je ook eens wat anders. In de buurt genoeg eettentjes en supermarkt om de hoek. Het huis van Michelle is van alle belangrijke benodigdheden voorzien. Zelfs de oordoppen voor degene die niet goed tegen buitengeluiden kunnen, had zij in huis! Ze had een ontbijt voor ons klaar gelegd omdat we pas in de avond aankwamen.....erg attent van haar. Ik kan haar huis aanraden en als ik weer in New York ben, ga ik zeker terug."

Apartment was very clean and close to the subway, which made getting into NYC really easy.  There is a supermarket next to the subway which had everything we needed for during our visit.  We had a very late flight and Michelle stored our luggage for the day as well as arranging a taxi to the airport.  I highly recommend and would stay again next time I'm in NY."

He personally greeted me, recommended some restaurants (I went to one and had amazing sushi) and showed patiently how the pool and refrigerator work. The apartment looks even better than on the pictures. I especially loved the rooftop with 360 view. I really had a good chance to relax and unwind in Cesars place. One thing to mention is that the apartment has a great energy all round, I would highly recommend it to anyone. "

The reason I came back is because besides marvelous view and the setup the place has this amazing energy which is especially rejuvenating after a stressful work period back in NYC. Wherever you are in the apartment your eyes are almost constantly facing the green if the trees, water and the Christo statue in the background which is very relaxing. \n\nDuring my starving was around 35C in Rio so I spend a good time in the pool which is very deep, clean and enjoyable. Tivesse so good I barely went to the gym which is literally minutes away. \n\nCesar was super kind, he is definitely not your regular Airbnb host. As he knows I like to cook potatoes he showed me how to cook Mandioca Brazilian potatoes with shrimps. It was an unforgettable cooking and gastronomic experience. \n\nI will certainly come back again next time I am in Ipanema. "

Overlooking Christ the Redeemer and the Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon, the apartment had spectacular views. Breakfast was served on weekdays, the apartment was sparkly clean, the small private pool was a special treat after exploring the city, and the views were one I won't forget. Conveniently located in Ipanema, the apartment is walking distance to grocery stores, world class restaurants, and beautiful beaches. Cesar was an incredibly kind host. He left us snacks on arrival and shared with us a cake upon departure. A truly kind spirit. The hardest part was leaving. Would love to return one day. Saudades!"

I enjoyed the time a lot.\n\nThe view from his rooftop terrace is just marvelous. \n\nI would rent the apartment definitely  again."

We will not forget the cherished experience he afforded. \n\n\nWe particularly enjoyed the cabin's  rare blend of rustic charm and meticulously maintained, modern elegance. The beautiful wood interior with exposed beams, light scent of cedar, old-fashioned fireplace, and free-standing antique tub, all made the cabin incredibly charming. The wrap-around porch was not only scenic, but very quiet and mosquito free. It was a wonderful place to chat in the evenings, read selections from the bookshelf, and to enjoy the delicious breakfast items provided, including fresh papaya. Since the cabin resides at the end of the residential area, the only thing visible for miles from the back porch was lush, pristine forest. The cabin's enveloping sense of privacy was relaxing and romantic. \n\nWith respect to the cabin's modern appeal, where does one begin? Even the toaster lowered the bread automatically. One can enjoy coffee prepared by three different methods, including French press, and Mike made sure we had ample amounts of freshly ground coffee. The stainless steel fridge was packed with complementary goodies as well. Being expert snackers, we were quite pleased. \n\nThis understood, the modern conveniences went far beyond food. We enjoyed being able to dim the lights just the right amount in each room to create the desired ambiance. The king-sized bed in the loft was incredibly comfortable and featured three types of pillows, including a memory foam option. But the aspect of our stay we liked the most had to do with the modern architecture of the cabin itself. The walls of the A-frame design, both behind the bed and in front of it, feature large windows with breathtaking views of the forest. As a result, the typical distinction between interior and exterior does not apply. The effect was magical. Waking up in the morning, we were in awe. \n\nThanks again for everything, Mike. "

Mike didn't miss a single detail--truly! There were maps to navigate the vast expanse of the Big island's Volcano park; filtered water by the bedside; beautiful Hawaiian music playing from the Bluetooth speaker; local coffee & produce; headlamps to use in the volcano caves, etc (*this list is far more extensive). \r\n\r\nMike had a warmth about him you could immediately feel--and not the, 'I feel obliged to be pleasant', but a feeling of true hospitality and generosity. I live on Oahu and will certainly rent from Mike again in the near future!   "

Its totally private, with acres of Hawaiin jungle surrounding it. \n\nWe could not believe how modern the house was. In Hawaii, a lot of the houses are older and they have outdated furniture. This house was modern with beautiful furniture, gorgeous floors, and beautiful bathtub/sinks/counters. There are so many windows. There is an L-shaped wrap around deck that is massive. We spent almost all of our time sitting out there on the comfortable patio furniture, listening to the jungle, drinking our freshly prepared 100% Hawaiin coffee that our host provided. (Also, we didnt get a single mosquito bite. We never even saw any.) \n\nSpeaking of what the host provided for us: coffee, tea, oats, pancake mix, butter, sugar, syrup, fresh jam, eggs, orange juice, milk, chocolate, yogurt, and fruit. We were amazed. \n\nEvery detail of this house, each room, is modern, cozy and designed to make you feel like you are on a luxurious vacation. This place is 5 stars. We wished we'd known how awesome it was going to be, and stayed more than one night."

The owner, Mike, was prompt and thorough with all communications and incredibly informative about directions, dining recommendations, and local attractions. His love of not only the cabin, but the local community and environment was evident in every facet of our stay. From the locally grown coffee, fresh baked banana bread, and organic whole milk to the unique iron claw bath tub, cozy cotton bath robes, and natural rainwater supply, every nook and cranny of this endearing cabin reflected Mikes attention to detail and reverence for nature. This true getaway will bring total relaxation secluded in a rain forest where the pitter-patter of rain on a tin roof will lull you into a deep sleep only to awaken the next morning to the cool crisp air echoing with exotic bird calls. Best AirBnB experience that I have had yet! "

Die Lage, die Ausstattung, die Sauberkeit, bequemes Bett, alles hat gestimmt. \nMike ist sehr f\u00fcrsorglich und er hat die Cabin liebevoll eingerichtet. Man sp\u00fcrt, dass es ihm wichtig ist, dass die G\u00e4ste sich wohl f\u00fchlen (mehrere Blumengestecke, kuscheliger Morgenmantel)). Er hat zur Ben\u00fctzung ausf\u00fchrliche Instruktionen gegeben (Papaya zum Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck schon vorbereitet) und war bei Fragen  erreichbar.  \nPreislich ist die Cabin eher im oberen Segment, aber f\u00fcr eine kleine Ferien-H\u00fctte am Rand vom Naturschutztreservat mit Blick auf den wilden Urwald mit all seinen Annehmlichkeiten eigentlich unbezahlbar.\nEs kann bisweilen ziemlich k\u00fchl sein auf 1000 Fuss (?m), gegen Mittag f\u00e4ngt es auch h\u00e4ufig zu nieseln / regnen an. Hatte h\u00e4ufig meine Daunenjacke an, Heizungsl\u00fcfter w\u00e4re bei Bedarf vorhanden. Ich habe 2 N\u00e4chte gebucht. Mit allem was es im Vulkanpark zu sehen gibt,  k\u00f6nnte man durchaus auch noch l\u00e4nger da verweilen. \n\nZus\u00e4tzlich ist Mike als erfahrener \"Seeb\u00e4r\" (eigenes Schiff) darauf bedacht, dass auch Kleinigkeiten stimmen, die einem das Leben erleichtern ( hawaianische Musik ab MP3 Player, grosse Bibliothek \u00fcber Hawaii ( Pflanzen, Tiere, Geschichtevetc etc). Er hat zudem ein grosses Wissen \u00fcber einheimische Pflanzen und Tiere, die er einem gerne weitergibt.\nEr geht praktisch jeden Morgen zum Vulkan. Er hat mich spontan um 05 30 fr\u00fchmorgends zum \"glow\"  mitgenommen (leuchten der Magma, am besten b Sonnen auf oder -Untergang sichtbar). Danach haben wir in der Milit\u00e4r- basis im Park gefr\u00fchst\u00fcckt und \u00fcber \"Gott ind die Welt\" gesprochen. \nThanks for all that, dear Mike. I appreciated my stay a lot. It was wonderfull!"

If you're looking at other places, trust me when I tell you that you have found the perfect place in the Flying Cloud Cabin. I don't think I have enough space to really describe just how awesome of an experience Mike helped us have, but I'll definitely try.\r\n\r\nThe location is fantastic, and about as close as you can be to Volcano park without actually staying inside it. We were able to easily make our way to some of the most remote locations of the park without having to worry about when we would get back to the cabin. \r\n\r\nThe amenities were beyond belief. Mike provided a warm in-person greeting despite our late night arrival, and had just about everything ready that you could imagine. The fridge was well stocked with juice, jams, eggs, fruit, and a few other tasty treats ready for us to consume. He gave us a quick tour around, made sure we had an answer to all our questions, and even had two wonderfully fuzzy robes ready for us.\r\n\r\nIf you don't know what to do in Volcano, don't worry! Mike has great recommendations of what to do anywhere on the island, and gave us great ideas for where to go inside the park and around volcano as well.\r\n\r\nIf this hasn't convinced you already, I'm not sure what will. This is hands down the best place I have ever stayed. Come here, have a wonderful time, and enjoy!"

He decorated it with amazing iterior and mardern electric facilities.\r\nOf course, Mike himself is the point. He's so kind and was waiting for us in the raining evening even we were a little bit late. he shows us aroung the place and all free food and fruits prepared for us. Especially he show me his cool boat picture cause he knew me as a sailer. But I should say Mike is a sailing master cause he crossed Pacific for 3 times.\r\nMike gave us a very important suggestion that we'd better to observ the Lawa at night time even we just arriveed. Then we had a truelly impressive outlook at the top os Kilauea and took photoes over the night, incluing Starry Night Sky and Milky Way.\r\nNow it comes the sunny morning but we shoule leave.

So nice to be abe to relax each morning and enjoy the rainforest around us. So beautiful! Also, location is awesome - minutes to the volcano crater lookout so we went each night after dinner.

My wife and I stayed for 4 nights during our honeymoon and absolutely loved it. This gave us enough time to explore VNP, drive to Kalapana and bike to the lava flow, and to just relax and enjoy the cabin. \n\nThe location is perfect. It's less than 10 minutes from the entrance of the park and we found ourselves going early in the morning to beat the crowd and after dark to see the volcano glow from the Jagger Museum. The cabin is completely secluded but only a short drive from the highway. Just over the highway there are several restaurants and convenience stores. We really enjoyed dinner at the Kilauea Lodge. \n\nThe cabin itself is beautiful and charming. Mike has thought of absolutely everything and was very attentive to any needs we had. We could see the sunrise from our bed and on a clear night we could see the moon and stars. The cabin can be chilly at night and the area can get cold and rainy, so pack accordingly. One night we took advantage of the fireplace which was great. \n\nMike was the best airbnb host I've had and we wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. "

Thank you Mike!\r\n5* hotels cannot compete with the beautiful cabin that Mike has in front of the jungle, fully equipped to relax and enjoy the views and your company during the stay. \r\nIt was raining and a bit cold when we stayed, so we couldn't really enjoy the terrace but the inside is just incredible!\r\nGo there, you will not regret it!"

All breakfast items were provided, plus a great selection of maps and hikes around the volcano and he island. Do remember that it can get chilly in the fall/winter!

          "comments": "From what I had read in reviews by others who had stayed at the Flying Cloud, we expected to have a good experience, but it's hard to overstate how truly fabulous it was. Mike was a warm, helpful, thoughtful host, and every detail of the cabin was amazing. It smelled good walking into it--from the cedar it's made of--and everything inside was immaculate. The photos of the cabin itself don't do justice to the space, the light, the furniture, the attention to detail.\r\n\r\nMike answered my numerous questions via email quickly and thoroughly, left lots of delicious food for us (yogurt, granola, fresh fruit, pumpkin bread, bagels, wonderful juices), and offered great advice about what to see and do. (Don't miss the Volcano farmer's market if you're there on a Sunday morning.)\r\n\r\nIt's a luxury to have the half-bathroom upstairs in addition to the full one downstairs. The bed was super comfortable. Mike had thought of everything: binoculars, umbrellas, flashlights, guidebooks. The cabin was spacious and cozy at once. I cannot recommend this place more highly.\r\n"

The cabin is just a short drive from Volcano National Park, which made is easy for us to pop over multiple times to see the lava and other attractions both during the day and at night. \r\n\r\nThere are a number of restaurants nearby in Volcano Village, and a small convenience store for buying food. Mike provides a really nice spread for breakfast though (we had eggs, granola, yogurt, fresh papaya, english muffins, local spreads and jams, and a myriad of other things to fill us up), so chances are you won't need to buy much. Mike even dropped off a warm loaf of pumpkin bread one morning!\r\n\r\nMike seems to have thought of everything you could possibly need while at his place - he has binoculars, headlamps and maps available for trips to the park, lots of blankets to keep you warm, and he even offered to start a fire for us. His cabin is lovely, and bigger than it appears in the photos. This is the perfect place to stay if you want a romantic spot to relax and check out the volcano. \r\n\r\n"

          "comments": "Mike is a delightfully pleasant and affable host with an almost heavenly place in the clouds you get the pleasure of sharing for a while. There are so many things to say here, but I'll just focus on the two most important and overarching areas of interest: the host and the home. The most accurate description I can relinquish of this host (Mike) is that he was kind, organized, informed, and impressively meticulous in his attention to detail. We actually ran into him by coincidence while out hiking the VNP trails and we were glad to share in part of a hike with him to have the chance to get to know him better. Our brief Mike-guided tour was just a nice bonus as he is an admirable conversationalist with an interesting life and is very knowledgeable of the VNP area. We have personally ranked him as our overall best host in all of our AirBnB stays to date, and that is saying a lot as we have been very fortunate to have nearly all positive experiences via AirBnB. Albeit, Mike sets the bar really high; the previous makes sense given he basically lives in the clouds in the shadow of a volcano. The home was incredible and in retrospect remains our favorite place we stayed this year on the islands of Hawaii and Maui (out of 7 other homes and/or hotels). Mike has obviously placed a lot of consideration into this offering and continues to build upon a rock solid foundation of thoughtful hosting. He easily supplies every utensil, comfort, amenity, and convenience you could expect and/or want in this upscaled cabin. There are all the expected and unexpected kitchen fixings, a small library in a large wall-shelf filled with Hawaii-centric materials, several dehumidifiers, music and lighting that just delivers a very creature-comfort cabin experience, and a slew of other add-ons provided to make life just a little easier on your trip. The interior of this house has so many fine things it's hard to list but our personal favorites were the 100-year old clawfoot tub (also functions as a standing shower), the tempur-pedic bed and ultra comfortable bedding, and last but not least the carefully selected combinations of wood all throughout the house, which make it feel like it's both somewhere old and somewhere new to its guest as well as blends the home into its earthy and forested setting just outside the glass doors. The lanai wraps around the unit and makes for an amazingly tranquil place to eat a meal or listen and watch the rain. The surrounding area is residential but spread out and Mike's place seems like it's in own little universe, tucked between the trees. We found the flying cloud was easy to find (via GPS) and an absolutely perfect spot for those looking to enjoy the VNP as its very close (<10mins) and makes for a seems-to-good-to-be-true home base. There are plenty of other things I could continue on to say in..."

His eye for detail, organized manner, and thoughtfulness comes across in so many tiny details in the cabin that will make your stay that much more comfortable. The same can be said of his communication and cabin's (Website hidden by Airbnb) was very kind of him in getting us warm pumpkin bread and papaya on the second day of our stay - which were so tasty. He also gave us helpful suggestions/information on places/hikes to visit/do and best timings for them. \n\nThe cabin itself is beautiful with its big lanai overlooking the rainforest, and big windows bringing the outside in being the highlights for us. We enjoyed sitting out and hearing the sounds of the rainforest and the wind in the pitch dark night, sleeping to the melodious pattering of the rain on the roof, and waking up to the view of the rainforest outside your bedroom windows. The cabin has a well equipped and well stocked kitchen, which was very helpful for us as we cooked our meals. The rest of the cabin was very comfortable as well.\n\nThank you Mike.  We look forward to staying here again."

He met us at the cabin when we arrived, told us about the area as well as anything we could possibly need to know about the cabin. He also had a stocked fridge with essentials, interesting books on the volcano, and about five different ways to make coffee. On top of that, he gave us great advice about hikes and how best to enjoy the volcano. \n\nThe cabin itself is truly amazing. The great pictures don't even do it justice. He clearly puts so much thought and care into every detail. \n\nThe location is perfect for seeing the volcano (an easy five minute drive to the park entrance). \n\nThis will be one of the best AirBnbs you will ever stay at. It's pretty much that simple. Thank you for one of the best stays of our honeymoon, Mike! We will be back! "

The tree ferns off the back porch beckon to the 25000 acres of tropical rainforest beyond. Bask in the light of the full moon coming through the 'front window' as you sleep in the king-sized loft bed. The host does a wonderful introduction to 'Flying Cloud' which includes the on site iPad with links to the popular attractions of the area. To the science buffs out there, prepare to be delighted. Are you a sailor perhaps? The host will regale you with tales. Two days is barely enough time to experience the area.\nI could not recommend this place more highly. A marvelous piece of tropical high-altitude 'wet coast' Hawaiian paradise awaits the visitor to 'Ao Lele Flying Cloud'. Pictures do not do it justice and pictures though worth a 1000 words barely suffice.\n"

It is so close to Volcano National Park but still feels very secluded, like you are in the middle of the rainforest (which you are!). It is even more beautiful than the pictures and I cannot recommend it highly enough. \n\nMike is the definition of above and beyond. From waiting in the driveway with an umbrella to carry our bags and protect us from the rain upon our arrival to dropping off freshly baked pumpkin bread one morning, he thinks of everything and is a very kind and considerate person. This was by far the most thorough check-in I've ever had on AirBnB, as he walked us through every detail of the cottage that we would need to know, including the many different approaches to coffee-making that were available! I'm sure he would have been happy to help if we had any questions, but he was so thorough in explanations of not only the cottage but also the national park and the Volcano community that we never had any. He obviously loves this cottage very much and you will too. \n\nMy only tip is that it does get cool in the mornings and evenings. Mike warned us about this and provided firewood, a space heater and fluffy robes so it's not a problem, but my tip is to make bring some warm lounge-wear to make the mornings and evenings even cosier, which not everybody would think about planning a trip to Hawaii.

As a result, we did not stay and found accommodations elsewhere.  The home appeared clean but the host was clearly obsessed and spent a full hour telling us the do's & don'ts, while our dinners got cold and we were shivering on the porch... Ex: don't cook steak (no ventilation), don't leave the bathroom door open (humidity issue), don't wear shoes in the house, don't bring your suitcases upstairs to the bedroom, don't be concerned that the bedroom has no curtains, don't use the lights or the space heater too much because electricity is expensive in Hawaii, don't be alarmed to see the host working in the yard during our stay, and don't be alarmed if the host comes into the house while we're gone to get his yard tools, and on and on for an hour.  The whole experience was bizarre and uncomfortable.  The host wouldn't leave until we told him we had heard enough, that it was very late, that our dinners were now cold and so were we, and our groceries were sitting on the counter unpacked.  About an hour after the host finally left, my husband attempted to bathe and fell in the tub.  He could barely get out of the tub without falling again.  In all our stays in private homes and hotels, we have never previously experienced a tub so slippery.  While we were willing to overlook the host's bizarre behavior and rules, the unsafe tub was unacceptable.    "

He went around and showed us his stunning home, a little piece of paradise, and fully equipped with anything you could need.  He supplied us with a wonderful breakfast spread (inc but not limited to coffee, eggs, papaya, cereal, oatmeal, yogurt- and all different varieties to choose from!)  He was nothing but helpful, occasionally checking in on us to see if we needed anything via the airbnb app.  We would often come back from the day to find he restocked all the food and even cleaned the sheets/towels mid-way through our stay (we stayed an entire week.)  He was helpful but also respected our privacy - we never saw him our entire stay.  \n\nThe pictures of the house do not do it justice.  It feels very secluded and yet is a minute from the main town road and a minute drive to Volcano National Park.  He has beach towels, a cooler, water bottles, head lamps for night walks, cozy blankets, plenty of pots/pans and other cooking supplies and spices you may need.  Mike also has a suggestion box in case we thought of something to make the place better, but we couldn't think of anything!\n\nAll in all, great location (short drive to Hilo, we rented jeep and traveled the whole island during our stay.), cozy and secluded house, great supplies, and a generous and helpful host.  Cannot recommend enough!"

There were trail guides, books, different types of coffee makers and toasters, a bag for shopping at the farmers market, an I-pad that had an app focused on the caldera so we could see when would be a good time to view it...  every time we turned around there was time other little detail that was there fir us to appreciate.

It was an extremely nice place that is meticulously cared for, and Mike gives you detailed instructions on how to maximize your stay in the cottage. You will definitely want to build in time to just hang out and relax in this amazing retreat - sitting in your robe on the sofa, in bed or on the covered porch watching the jungle and listening to the rain was extremely relaxing. Definitely just take all of the suggestions Mike gives when he checks you in, because they are all spot on. Biggest suggestion for staying in Volcano is to grocery shop in a real town before you get there, and buy ingredients for cooking because the kitchen is really well set up and once you are in for the evening you won't want to go out. He has breakfast supplies for you including oatmeal, cereal, milk, pancake mix, orange juice, and chocolate!"

We were able to not only explore volcano (the Kilauea lava lake was quite high and lava was visible) but we could time our night-viewing based on checking out the suggested USGS webcam set up on Mike's ipad. We missed viewing the first night because we hit some fog but were able to return the following night to an intensely beautiful milky way/night sky contrasted with the glorious glow of Kilauea. Although Volcano is remote, it is a great set up to check out the green and black sand beaches. Mike is so thoughtful and aware of some of the limitations of the small town, he provided a wonderful little spread so that we might enjoy home-cooked breakfast and teas. He also has an extensive coffee setup for coffee folks as well. We slept very well and there are extra touches like comfortable bedding and thick towels that show Mike's put a lot of thought into folks' stays. It does get chilly in volcano but he's got that covered too; there is rain gear, a little stove that can be lit and small space heater if the temps dip. Do bring layers if you can particularly if it's winter since elevation is >4K feet. Would've stayed longer if we could, don't miss Mike's place!"

The backyard is literally 20,000 acres of untouched forest. It is incredibly private and secluded, yet is only a 5 minute drive to get dinner/food. For a \"rustic\" style place, it is absolutely modern and very clean.\n\nMike takes care of the place so well. Everything is in perfect functioning condition and he obviously cares a lot about the place and your stay in it.\n\nLastly, Mike has an impeccable attention to detail. He even lit a fire in the wood burning stove because he knew we were coming and it was raining out. The bed and pillows were so comfortable; everything is beautifully matching (e.g. the soap dispenser, toilet flusher, and TP holder are all bronze brushed steel -- he has a knack for design); everything is premium and high quality! By the way, if you're a coffee hound like I am, he has an Aeropress for your use!\n\nWe didn't expect it, but staying at Mike's place was one of the highlights of our trip. It will be for you too, trust me!"

This absurdly clean cabin is set in a beautiful fern forest very close to the entrance to the volcano park, and although it rained during our entire stay we still had an amazing time cozying up here. Mike was super helpful, even built us a fire while we were out most days we stayed. Other good things:\n- Very comfy bed\n- Cleanest airbnb I've ever stayed in: you can tell Mike really cares for this place\n- Great kitchen amenities, if your style is to stay in and cook like ours\n- Fresh/delicious breakfast spread, which Mike restocked during our stay\n- Location: great if you're more into lush jungle vibe rather than beachy resort. Even though it was cloudy/rainy most of the time we were there in mid-February, we were so close to the park that the instant the weather cleared we were able to go see \"the glow\" of Halemaumau: the fog can descend in an instant during the winter (as it did for us) and you have to be close by to catch a good glimpse!\n\nThanks again for a wonderful cozy cabin stay."

He's definitely thought of everything when it comes to the cleanliness of the place, to the coffe/tea and breakfast provisions he has on hand for you, to the plush towels and comfortable bedding. All in all, this was an awesome place to stay. Being in the middle of the rain forest was both relaxing and rejuvenating. You are close enough to local attractions but feel like you're in your own little world. Mike had great recommendations on places to visit and see, which made our time here even better. It's easy to see why so many people have given such positive ratings here. It definitely didn't disappoint! Mahalo!!"

Mike is attentive to every detail, the masterful gardening of this rainforest location, the peaceful lighting that he has fine tuned in the cabin, and the collection of music and books all set the stage for relaxation and clearing your mind of the world, focusing on what matters in life, the journey.  Don\u2019t look any further, you will be very happy here if you want to unwind and have a home base for the Big Island.  Mahalo Mike!"

There is adequate wi-fi when you need it. I travel for a living so the last thing I want on vaca is a stale hotel room. Flying cloud is a very private and cozy retreat. We picked this place out of many others that were available in the area because we wanted a nature infused seclusion. We have a 5 yr old daughter left back home with grandma and this was exactly what we needed. Easy access to Hilo , Volcano and other points of interest on the island. I proposed to my long time (15yr) side kick during a day trip to the southern most point of US. I\u2019ve been to 42 of the 50 states now and i have to say the big island is one of the most beautiful scenic places I have ever experienced. Stay here you won\u2019t be disappointed. Mike was great upon check in. Extremely thorough and engaging. After the initial orientation we never saw him again. We were left to enjoy all that the big island has to discover."

Here, you sit on the lanai above the tree tops listening to birds sing during the day and watch the stars at night.  Upon arrival you are greeted by the most gracious host, Mike. He's kind, funny, and very knowledgeable about The Big Island.  He gives you the grand tour of the immaculate cabin space - answering any and all questions. We look forward to our return!"

We enjoyed it as our base camp for exploring Volcano's Natl Park, the farmers market in Volcano and the rest of the Islands beautiful sights.

The house is gorgeous and sitting on the lanai with a cup of tea or coffee is just breathtaking. This Airbnb ist the cleanest, we\u2018ve ever stayed at. Everything has it\u2019s place and nothing is missing. You can see that Mike has an eye for detail, not a hook or whatever you could ever wish for is missing. He is very organized and you see that in his house. Yes, he has rules, but those rules will guarantee that you will stay in a perfect vacation home. You won\u2019t find a little bit of dust or water stains on glasses or cutlery. Everything is of highest quality and he even has an Aeropress :) Love, love, love! He sat the bar VERY high, you\u2019ll see."

Das Apartment liegt wie auf den Fotos erkennbar zur hinteren Seite, sodass wir von dem munteren Leben auf der wirklich sch\u00f6nen Rua das Flores innerhalb der Wohnung nichts mitbekommen haben. Andreia f\u00fchrte uns bei der Begr\u00fc\u00dfung nach oben und zeigte uns die R\u00e4umlichkeiten, welche den Eindruck best\u00e4tigen, der durch die Fotos entstanden ist: F\u00fcr einen Kurztrip, wo ihr die meiste Zeit des Tages au\u00dferhalb verbringt. In der Parallelstra\u00dfe \u00fcberhalb der Rua das Flores befindet sich ein Supermarkt an dem wir uns mit dem n\u00f6tigsten an Verpflegung f\u00fcr unseren Aufenthalt ausstatten konnten. Dar\u00fcber hinaus gab uns Andreia viele Tipps zur Freizeitgestaltung in Porto. S\u00e4mtliche Anziehungspunkte sind aufgrund der zentralen Lage super einfach und in der Regel innerhalb von 10 - 15 Minuten Fu\u00dfmarsch zu erreichen. An der angrenzenden Station Sao Bento f\u00e4hrt auch die Buslinie 500, welche euch in ca. 40 Minuten zum Stadtstrand in Matosinhos bringt. Wir haben die vier Tage in Porto sehr genossen und netterweise k\u00fcmmerte sich Andreia am letzten Tag sogar noch darum, dass wir unser Gep\u00e4ck nach dem Checkout sicher f\u00fcr ein paar Stunden verstauen konnten. Ich kann dieses Apartment nur w\u00e4rmstens weiter empfehlen!"

There are many restaurants and shops close by. Despite the central location, we had no issues with noise at night. The apartment was very clean and accurately reflected in the pictures. It served our purposes very well. Because we visit in the winter, the apartment was slightly cold, but Andreia provided an additional heater which was enough. \n\nAndreia was also very responsive to our requests and issues. We even allowed us to store our luggage at her workplace after our check out, which was so nice of her. \n\nOverall, would highly recommend the apartment complex!"

De locatie, pal tegenover het centraal station S\u00e3o Bento, is ideaal. Van hieruit is de stad goed te ontdekken, zowel te voet als per bus/metro/trein. \n\nAndreia is een fijne Airbnb hostes. Ze reageert snel op berichten en denkt goed mee. Zo waren wij 's ochtends al vroeg gearriveerd in Porto en zaten we met onze bagage. Eigenlijk konden we pas om 15:00 uur inchecken, maar van Andreia heeft ervoor gezorgd dat we de bagage al konden droppen in het appartement. \n\nWij hebben een superfijne tijd gehad!

If you are into lush rainforests, organic fruits/veggies/nuts growing on-site, and stellar landscaping - than this is your place. The room is very very nice and the property is super cool. The donkey, Mocha, is fun to see work his magic and the house puppy is really cute. Meanwhile, Sherry is a great host who gave me a very thorough intro to organic farming and a lot of encouragement to get starred myself. Highly recommend this place. NOTE - be sure to follow Sherry'a directions here and NOT (Hidden by Airbnb) /apple maps. Your tires will thank you!"

(F\u00fcr den Fall, dass es zu laut ist, hat Sherri Kopfh\u00f6rer und Ohropax bereitgelegt.)

If you are an animal lover, this is the place to go.  It's a bit remote (bring a prepared dinner with you because you won't want to leave once you're there), but the upstairs room is so wonderful to be in, three sides with windows that look out into the garden and the palm trees.  It has a real tree house feel to it.  Sherrie showed me how to feed papaya peels to the donkey, and Mr. Chris, the cat, bounded in the door when I opened it and spent the nights with me on the king-size bed, which was a treat for me.  If you are an adventurer and love being in open air, with the sounds of frogs at night, this is a wonderful stop just outside of Hilo and Keaau."

The garden was lush and the animals were really cute.  The night sounds were great, although some people may be more sensitive to it (Sherri has provided earplugs if that turns out to be the case).\r\n\r\nSherri is an extremely welcoming host and did everything to make us feel comfortable.  We were welcomed to the place but then left in complete privacy.  When we had a question, she was extremely quick to respond and accommodating in every way."

Sherri was so sweet and welcoming and really made us feel comfortable. She has a donkey and goat and adorable little critters that you can play with and it was a lovely experience. We unfortunately had a travel issue and had to depart early but in our short stay it was clear Sherri has a little slice of heaven in paradise.  The attached apartment has everything you need and Sherri has put her own artistic touch on the place.  It is spacious for 2 people and just a short ride to downtown Hilo. Would definitely stay again."

No people around.\n3) Beautiful nature. There are many windows in bedroom, it's possible to imagine that you are sleeping in jungle.\n4) Close to Hilo, Volcanoes National Park.\nPros/cons: \n1) I like to sleep listening sounds of nature: rain, birds singing and so on. But the second person in our party used earplugs provided by Sherri. So it depends on you if this is pros or cons.\n\nNeed to mention: the road is unpaved. We rented SUV, so no problems at all. But I think, that \"smaller\" cars are suitable as well."

Sherri is a true artist, her art is everywhere around the property from the floor to the ceilings and outside.  Everything is so pretty and dream-like so \"Enchanted gardens\" is fitting. Little touches throughout the home really tie everything together. the property is somewhat remote but only a short drive to town, the beach, and Volcano national park. You get the perks of being surrounded in rainforest and privacy but still get convenience, wifi, and hot water. \nSherri was so helpful with anything we needed; she shared her art supplies with me and loaned us snorkel equipment and pool noodles after telling us the best spots on the island. \nSherri and the animals were all sweet hearts. My favorite was the lovable pup, the friendly donkey and the happy chickens walking about the yard. She provided fresh fruit daily and offered us any fruit growing on the property. She even gave me a beautiful bouquet to take home with me. It was wonderful! \nMy fianc\u00e9 and I decided to get married on the big island, and we TRULY could not have had a better time or stayed anywhere better. Great for couples who want to adventure but have somewhere beautiful to come home to! Enjoy your trip, book Sherri!!!!"

Located in the rain  forest outside of Hilo, it's a bit of a drive to get there but worth it for the quiet and intense green vegetation that surrounds the place.  The rain was constant  - at least during our stay - but it's not cold, just cool.  The house itself is funky and full of Sherri's handicrafts, art and artifacts.  Sherri was a great and understanding host as well.  Would love to come back next time!"

Very peaceful because the unit doesn't share any walls, ceilings, or floors with anyone else.  We loved falling asleep to the sounds of the forest and the rain. Sherri has created a unique and beautiful paradise here.  All of the animals are charming, especially the donkey.  If you stay on a Wednesday, be sure to visit Uncle Robert's Night Market for live music, food, and a great view of the glow from Kilauea.  Sherri was extremely responsive and accomodating. "

The apartment is rather equipped like a hotel suit but Osman is very helpful and he will surely try to accommodate if you have additional requests (he bought a new iron as I have needed one). I think this apartment is a perfect alternative to a hotel in order to get a excellent location and good decoration for a reasonable price."

There is also supermarket just around the corner. So very convenient! We had everything we needed in the apartment, but don't expect 5star hotel :) It is cosy home atmosphere. There are some problem in shower as water is passing by and getting on floor, but otherwise all is good :) Thank's for Osman and his team! Osman was very responsive, when I had some doubts due to not calm situation in Taksim square. Luckily all was good :) I can for sure recommend Osman and his apartments as home out of home :) "

Our host and landlord Osman cannot be faulted. He was there for any of out needs and questions and was continuously welcoming and friendly during out stay. I will be returning in the future and could not imagine a better place to stay. The area of the apartment was perfect. A stone throw away from the main street and taxsim square and a 5 minute walk to kabatas. I couldn't think of a better place to stay if your a family or a young group like we were. I cannot recommend this more. THANK YOU OSMAN"

Apartments are clean and well furnished.  \r\nOsman took great care of us.  Because the person before us had not checked out from our room when we arrived, Osman placed us in a different room, then moved us to a top floor penthouse for our second night. The view from the roof top suite the second night was fantastic. Osman was very responsive and easy to work with.  I highly recommend staying in his apartments when in Istanbul. "

Sleeping was comfortable for each of us, Osman provided us after request with extra blanket so that we didnt have to sleep under one for couples. The apartment provided also free Wifi which was working great and there was also hair dryer which we apreciated a lot. We would definitely recommend this appartment to our friends. "

People seem to look for appartments in Sultanahmet were tourist attractions are, but to us there is absolutely no need for that - you go there once or twice and thats it. Taxim is real center, and you can easily walk to some other great parts of Istanbul  from there (Dolmabahce palace, Istanbul Moderna, Istiklal street...) or take cab that is really cheap. Plus, as I said appartment is cozy and clean, and Osman is like the good host, there for most of the times (which is not always the case). Recomendation for sure!\r\n"

Osman and his friends are very polite and helpful. the building has about 5 or six apartments each one including a living room, a bedroom and bathroom. there is s nice real bed in the bedroom and although 2 sofabeds in the living room. There is although a small kitchen with cooking stuff with help you to reduce your eating costs so much. the place of the residence is also very good.Just about 3 to 4 minutes far from Taksim square. When we got the apartment in the early morning, actually 3 hours before the check-in time, Osman was so kind to give us another apartment until our apartment gets ready. In the same way, because we were about to leave Istanbul some hours after the check out time, Osman helped us to leave our staff in his office and enjoy our last hours in the city. and the photos are exactly the same as the apartment. I highly recommend the apartment."

We were 4 and we felt very comfortable sleeping in a large bed in a separate room and 2 comfortable sofa-beds for 1 person each (could also be 2 and 1).  Although the kitchen is a bit small we managed to cook most of the meals there (there is a Carrefour grocery store 30m away).  There is also a lot of very good restaurants nearby.\r\n\r\nThe flat is very safe as Osman or one of his friends is always on site to control who enters the building.\r\n\r\nThe flat is about 30 minutes from the airport (Ataturk) by taxi.\r\n\r\nThank you Osman for a perfect stay in the wonderful Istanbul!"

Osman provided clear instructions to get there and was waiting for us upon our arrival. The other people who man the desk in this building don't really speak English, but they could always call Osman for help which they did. He was helpful with other questions we had too. There was a problem with the plumbing in the bathroom, some leaking around the base of the toilet - which made the small bathroom quite wet. Osman offered to have it fixed while we were there to be fair, but we didn't want a tradesman through during our stay. It will hopefully be repaired when you stay here. The electric stove top did not seem to work, but all other appliances did. All in all, we really enjoyed our stay."

Osman organised a private  airport pick-up for us which is easier than finding a taxi and not much more expensive.\r\nThe only issue was that the lift (elevator) is actually inside the apartment. Each apartment has its own key which only allows you to access that floor......but somehow there was a problem with the key of another apartment and they came to our floor by mistake and arrived in our apartment! Quite a shock to find them in our kitchen, but luckily they were just friendly and confused tourists. The whole building seems to be just 4-5 apartments rented only to tourists. Anyway, this is a security issue and needs to be fixed. "

The location is near Taksim but pretty difficult to access by taxi (lot of stairs and slopes before getting to Taksim). \r\nDie Wohnung befindet sich im Stadtzentrum, so dass man eigentlich alle wichtigen Sehensw\u00fcrdigkeiten zu fu\u00df erreichen kann. Die Schl\u00fcssel\u00fcbergabe hat einwandfrei funktioniert, wir wurden direkt von Osmans Freund abgeholt und zur Wohnung gef\u00fchrt. Die Wohnung ist zwar sehr klein, aber genau wie auf den Fotos zu sehen. Ein Plus ist die sch\u00f6ne Dachterrasse, auf der man wunderbar fr\u00fchst\u00fccken kann."

Auch als wir so sp\u00e4t noch auf die Suche nach den n\u00e4chsten Kneipen gingen bekamen wir Hilfe.\r\nInsgesamt war es \u00fcberhaupt kein Problem nach irgendetwas zu fragen, Osman war immer hilfsbereit und freundlich!\r\nAuch mit der Wohnungsausstattung waren wir zufrieden.

We found transport links and getting around Istanbul very easy by both transport and foot. \n\nThe apartment was clean and perfect for us (a group of 4). It may feel smaller with such a group but it ticks all the boxes and was great value for money. \n  \nI would happily use Osman's apartments on any future return. Thank you!"

The location is perfect for sightseeing around Istanbul using busses, tram or taxi. There is a huge shopping street just 3 minutes away where you\u2018ll find shops, restaurants and bars. Overall, our stay in Istanbul was exceeding all our expectations and the apartment fit right in. Thank you!\nPS: The guy at the reception was super nice and welcoming. Thanks a lot!"

Location wise is close to the center like Taksim, Istiklal and even still walking distance to new/modern city around Sisli and Besiktas. \n\nBut the bathroom is very small and no sword hanger inside the bathroom just to hang our dirty clothes and towel. Just hang one or two hanger on the wall would be helpful."

It's clean, new, has a really nice kitchen, a very comfortable bed and is near the city center (we walked everyday). I highly recommend staying at Nuno's place. \u00a1Gracias por todo, Francisca!

Also perfect, if you arrive by car - free parking just in front. 15 mins walk to downtown but lot of cheap cafes and restaurants full of locals around.\nThe check-in was perfect. We got lots of information, what to do/see/where to eat. Thanks for that. \nThe Apartement is very small but for a short city visit, big enough. If you stay for a week or so, I would recommend a larger Apartement.  "

The location is perfect, right by the metro station and with lots of amenities such as cafes, supermarkets and restaurants within a short walk. The centre is walking distance away if you don't mind hills, we never took public transport our whole stay. We enjoyed breakfast on the terrace and having coffee, tea and water ready for our arrival was really helpful after a long journey. Thank you we'd love to come back one day!"

BUSES The 67 and 69 buses run along 7th avenue, and the 61 bus that runs along 9th street is also very close.  TAXI There are often green or yellow NYC taxis around. The green taxis work the same as the yellow but are designated specifically to stop in Brooklyn and boroughs other than Manhattan. There are many car services in the neighborhood as well (we\u2019ve had pretty good luck with Eastern). PARKING There is free parking on the numbered streets and metered parking on 7th Avenue. Read signs carefully for street cleaning rules.  CAR RENTAL There are many Zipcar locati",

It's also on the first floor, which is nice if you have heavy suitcases (it gets difficult lugging stuff up three flights of stairs). Even though it's on street level, the street is a quiet / residential one, and the entrance is some distance from the sidewalk\u2014so noise is not an issue. There are very nice restaurants and cafes less than a block or two away. Ildiko went the extra mile in stocking the apartment with essential items, including a fully stocked first-aid kit(!). Although I had office space in Manhattan, I spent all of my time working from home, because I didn't want to leave the house or this neighborhood. Prospect Park is also very close, which makes for a nice place to go for a walk and clear the mind. Definitely one of the nicest and most pleasant airbnb experiences I've had so far!"

O metro a duas quadras nos deixa a 25min de Manhattan. A pracinha para crian\u00e7as no parque \u00e9 incr\u00edvel e fica s\u00f3 a duas quadras. Ildako foi uma anfitri\u00e3 super prestativa e fez com que tudo fosse atendido da melhor maneira poss\u00edvel. Tem um p\u00e1tio \u00f3timo com esquilos onde tom\u00e1vamos caf\u00e9 da manh\u00e3 todos os dias. Recomendo! Se der, um dia voltarei com certeza."

You get morning light from the kitchen and bathroom windows, and afternoon light in the bedroom area.  The kitchen has everything you might need and the back yard area is super nice.  We had two people staying here - the bed and pull-out were both very comfortable and Ildiko made sure to get everything ready for our arrival (which was late at night, but she was amazingly accommodating and lives on the premises so can easily be reached).  The neighborhood is lovely - a short walk to Prospect Park and plenty to do on 7th avenue.  There is a subway stop nearby.  It was also nice to find a ground floor listing!  I definitely plan on staying here again."

The apartment was all we could have wished for and more than advertised!\r\n\r\nWe would have given this stay 5-stars except for the bed.  We prefer a bed that is a bit softer... however, that is just OUR preference and could be easily remedied by a \"two-inch magic foam\" mattress cover on top of the existing setup.  Some folks prefer a firm mattress, so... again... the softer mattress might be fine with most folks.\r\n\r\nAll things considered... we loved the place and the stay!  We would go back in an instant and on our next trip to the East Coast we will try to re- book.\r\n\r\nHappy Trails!\r\n\r\nJerry and Barbara Murry"

The heater worked more than expected during the coolest days.\nThe kitchen connected with the dining room is a plus, cooking was really a pleasure. Unfortunately, we could not enjoy the backyard which looks very pleasant in warmer weather.\n\nTons of restaurants, grocery stores and all kinds of shops are within walking distance, subway stations and bus lines as well. Prospect park is less than 10 min away.\n\nAll in all, staying at Ildiko's apartment was a great experience. I definitely plan to stay here again especially in summer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The truly wonderful music venue Barbes (our main reason for choosing this location), the F & G subway lines (get you to most places you would want to be), and Prospect Park all within a few minutes walk. The apartment has a great collection of books and CDs, which we highly appreciated, plus a nice outside space. The only thing we would have liked is more than just one towel each for a 9-night stay, particular given the lack of a washing machine/dryer. Communication was a little bit patchy, with access to the property only organised at the very last moment (whilst we were on a transatlantic flight), but ended up being fine. Without doubt would stay again."

It is an easy walk to Prospect Park as well as the F and G lines. The surrounding neighborhood is great for walking around, and there are lots of cute places to grab a bite to eat close by. We had no problem finding street parking. We did not meet the owner, but had great communication and easy check-in!"

The kitchen is huge and well equipped, and Ildiko thoughtfully provided hummus, Brie, and crackers for us on arrival. Great shower and strong wifi (both important to me). Easy access (no need to schlep suitcases up flights of stairs). Mattress is firm - fine with me but a matter of personal taste. It's queen size and there is a futon if you have a kid or friend along.  In summer there is a garden in the rear that would be a pleasant place to enjoy the outdoors in the heart of Brooklyn but away from the hustle and bustle. Numerous shops, delis, restaurants, coffee shops, and groceries within a short walk. We didn't use the TV or sound system (there is a library of CDs) but might do so on another visit -  they are a great amenity, as is the library of books on music and art."

The kitchen is well equipped for basic cooking and coffee making. The location  in Park Slope is fantastic, convenient to a subway stop and surrounded by good restaurants, markets and coffee shops.

The place was impeccably clean, the bed was very comfy.\nThere was no need for my parents-in-law to bring their own shampoo and shower gel - everything was there. Even coffee! The apartment itself is wonderful, with a very spacey kitchen. And it offers access to outdoor space which is great in summer. I will definitely recommend Ildiko\u2018s place to my next visitors!!!"

She was responsive to questions and the check-in was really easy. The bathroom was sparkling clean and has been newly renovated, and the kitchen/dining area was large enough to cook in and not feel cramped. There is a lovely garden in the back which we were told we could use but it was really hot when we were there so we didn't take advantage of that (but it looked really nice and peaceful). For location, you can't get much better than Park Slope! It's just a few blocks from the F/G or a short walk to the R line. There are tons of restaurants and shops nearby and it's a 5-10 minute walk to Prospect Park. This space is so inviting and comfortable, it was the perfect place to come back to at the end of a busy day touring the city. And you can't beat the price! We highly recommend and would definitely book again. "

Idilko is friendly, communicative and helpful, and the apartment has a great selection of maps for exploring the area, books and music for R&R.  I enjoyed the firm mattress, down pillows and soft cotton sheets, and a super-clean, spacious full bath was another plus. It was the ideal place for my stay in Brooklyn \u2013 thank you, Idilko!\n"

She was available if needed and was  enough accomodating for the check-out so everything went smoothly.\nThe apartment is spacious, functional and plenty of natural light. It is very convenient as well: all kinds of stores, markets, restaurants, subway stations are within walking distance. Prospect Park is two blocks away.\nThe kitchen is very well-equipped,  just perfect for cooking! I truly felt like a home away from home as well as saving money.\nI highly recommend Ildiko's place and would definitely plan on staying here again."

The house is stylish and simple, with impressive water views and only a short walk to the beach.  It managed to take 2 adults + 2 children + various other family members and friends with kids for BBQs without seeming crowded.  My sons were amazed to hear kookaburras and have a couple of parakeets come down to join us on the terrace at breakfast.  Susie the owner was very straightforward to deal with and added some really thoughtful touches to welcome us (Xmas tree, hamper, list of best caf\u00e9s and restaurants in the village).  Just be aware that you should rent a car to get around, same need if you stay anywhere  outside of the very centre of Sydney to be honest.  I highly recommend Aquila House for a genuine summer break."

A lovely area of welcoming neighbours and a selection of good shops/cafes, just a steep walk to the beach unfortunately which wasn't a problem for us, but perhaps the more elderly or young would have issues with. The house was as described and in a beautiful location on the northern beaches with the morning sun on the terrace for breakfast! Overall we had a fantastic family holiday here and would come again.

I am happy to share common spaces and amentities like the living room, cable tv and kitchen. Please be mindful of the shared spaces and maintaining cleanliness (guests are expected to wash their own dishes and wipe down counters after preparing meals). When using the stove I ask that you stay in the kitchen until you are finished cooking. I also prefer that gue",

I love the arts and have a background in theatre and music- and an interest in writing poetry. Although I dont drink or party, I am known to work it out on the dance floor! I talk on the phone a lot and am a morning gym person.\n\nI grew up in the midwest and have lived in NYC for about 13 years. Ive been in my current (3 bedroom) apartment for about 12 years and have been doing airbnb for about half of that time! I am in my mid 30's, I work from home and enjoy a friendly, clean, peaceful environment.\n\nIf im home, Im often working in my room/home office. From time to time i host small meetings in my room or living room. Guests are welcome to come and go as they please. Since i have 2 rooms on airbnb i just ask folks to be mindful of other people, shared bathroom and kitchen, etc.  Although i dont normally get to spend a lot of time with guests, I truly enjoy meeting new people and it means so much to me for people to enjoy my home. Given the high rate of gentrification where i live, im also happy to share more about local businesses to support that invest in families who have historically lived in this neighborhood. Feel free to ask!",

The neighbourhood was amazing, with small caf\u00e9s etc. with live music and local events on Franklin Ave (Little Zelda's, Cool Pony...), Brooklyn Botanic Garden + Brooklyn Museum + Prospect Park nearby. The apartment had a great kitchen, fully equipped and we sometimes took the dinner with us down to the front stairs on the street. Our room had a small walk-in closet and a bed, we also enjojyed the big living room. Rachael was so sweet. She worked a lot, but we could always ask her about anything. She had a great laughter and we sometimes chit chattet with her in the kitchen. We would definately recommend a stay in this great apartment!"

Rachael was very warm and welcoming and almost always available to ask questions of or even just have a chat with.\r\nThe house is in a really great old Brooklyn neighbourhood with plenty of character and some really great cafes, restaurants and vintage stores springing up just around the corner. The 2,3,4,5 trains are only a few minutes walk away so getting into Manhattan is a breeze.\r\nI look forward to staying back with Rachael again whenever I'm next visiting New York."

          "comments": "I really didn't feel that Rachel's room was adequately represented in the listing. It's very much an interior room, not just by a hall and a living room, but also by a staircase, the bathroom and the kitchen. It's in the center of the apartment. The openings are sheet rocked in, so have no insulation. There is no separation from the owner's unit downstairs. What this means is that sound (all sounds, casual sounds, everything)  is completely transparent within the room. I would not recommend for a light sleeper, or for someone who needs to feel a sense of privacy. \r\nI also wrote up front about what I needed. I didn't feel listened to at all. Then I was blamed being for not being up front (apparently because I didn't emphasize that I seriously needed what I needed), and then was also told when I was angry that my communication style is overwhelming. It actually made me feel pretty \"gas lighted.\"\r\nFinally, the apartment is extremely expensive even by NYC standards. My friends who visited me during my month long stay were aghast. They felt that what I was paying for the room was close to what the rent probably was for the whole apartment.\r\n...On the up-side the place is clean, and the neighborhood is great. The landlord downstairs is very nice too. For a few days of visiting if you're not noise sensitive, the apartment could be quite fine if you don't mind the price. "

It's decorated beautifully and she has set aside shelf space in the kitchen and bathroom to allow you to really feel at home. The bedroom is very comfortable, with a large closet and dresser to store your things. The bed is soooooo comfortable! I slept like a rock!\r\n\r\nThe apartment is half a block away from great restaurants and groceries on Franklin Ave and a super short walk to the 2, 3, 4, 5, and S trains, and an easy walk to the A and C trains at Fulton and the LIRR stop at Nostrand Ave which I walked to every morning while I was here. Ask Rachael for recommendations on food. She knows her stuff!\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Rachael, she is one of the nicest people you'll meet in New York City. I had a few problems moving in that were entirely my fault, but she was attentive and helpful far exceeding any expectations. She makes you feel welcome and at home from the minute you arrive and she's a joy to chat with when you have a minute.\r\n\r\nI would highly recommend this room to anyone coming to Brooklyn!"

We didn't see each other so often because she worked a lot and we went for trips to the city every morning. But when we did, she was always in a good mood, smiling and always helped us when we needed it and answered our typical tourist questions. The apartment was really nice, cozy and clean. We had everything we needed. Bed was very comfy, we had also plenty of space for our stuff - pretty big closet and chest of drawers. Living room and kitchen were available all the time. Our street and  whole neighborhood were really nice with lots of cafe places, restaurants, grocerys and everything you need. The closest subway station is like 5 minutes walking from home. So you can get to Manhattan very easy (2, 3, 4, 5 trains), there are also machines where you can buy your MetroCard. We really enjoyed our stay at Rachael's, she is great host and I would recommend it to everybody and definitely stay again when I come back to New York some time. :)"

We loved hearing her singing from her bedroom while at home!\r\n\r\nCrown Heights is a lively and characteristic neighborhood with lots of nice restaurants and bars.\r\n\r\nThe house is cozy and very warm (we liked this after walking all day long in a cold January!), we could use the kitchen whenever we wanted and eat in the homey living room.\r\nThe bedroom is clean and spacious. We appreciated the walk-in closet and the extras, like scented soaps, candles, shampoos..\r\n\r\nNext time we'll be back in NYC, we'll surely book this place again!!"

The room is just like shown in the pictures, very comfortable, quite and cosy, the bed is great, we slept very well! The location is great, with a lot of restaurants, bars and small shops, also very close to some Brooklyn's spots like Botanical Garden, Prospect Park and Brooklyn Museum. The subway is just 5min walking and just 15min to go to Manhattan Downtown. I felt very safe on the neighbourhood, even in late night. \r\nI really enjoyed my stay at Rachael's and highly recommend to all! "

It was actually almost like having the place to ourselves, we had continuous access to the living room, and there was enough storage space in the bedroom for two people. The location is lovely, many cool restaurants, coffee shops on Franklin Av and in the neighborhood.\nThe only thing if I have to mention something negative, would be that at one point we went for about 10 days without cleaning and things started to be not so neat.\nOverall great stay, I would recommend Rachael to anyone."

I especially loved the bed and the fact that the room had a huge closet, for NYC standards, of course. I was also able to use her kitchen, and she left space for me to put some things in the fridge, which was so nice. The location of her place was also great. Crown Heights is an amazing neighborhood, and her place was just a few blocks from the 2/3/4/5 trains. Overall, I loved my stay and highly recommend Rachael's place! "

It is very convenient to get to Manhattan (15 minutes by subway to Wall Street station). Rachael is a great hostess. She is very positive, sociable and caring. Rachael cooks very tasty. She treated us to a vegetable dish, which we called the Brooklyn delicacy from Rachael. I will recommend Rachael's apartment for visiting New York to all my friends.\nMany thanks, Rachael!"

      "neighborhood_overview": "The apartment is located in Morningside Heights, a picturesque neighborhood just north of Manhattan's Upper West Side. It is just across the street from Columbia's historic campus and less than a block away from the beautiful and green Riverside Park, a great place for a relaxing stroll, jog or bike ride along the Hudson River. It's also walking distance from Harlem, Central Park, and the Upper West Side. The neighborhood is also home to Barnard College, Grant's Tomb, Riverside Church, The Cathedral of St. John the Divine, Morningside Park, and an assortment of great restaurants, cafes, diners, book shops, and stores and shops of every kind. Morningside Heights is simultaneously vibrant and low-key, an area that many say is one of the few remaining genuinely 'neighborly' neighborhoods in NYC - a great place to stay when visiting the city.",

Not only was the place exactly what we needed but Paul is a genuinely nice, kind, interesting human being and it has been a pleasure to get to know him. We stayed as a couple for just over a month and miss it already. Paul showed us around the neighbourhood when we first got there and was easily contactable thereafter.\r\n\r\nPaul's place is a unique gem decorated with his quirky eye for colour, style and collectible treasures. It has a cozy well decked out living room, a bedroom with a closet and a comfortable bed, spacious bathroom and a nice, sunny, open-plan kitchen surrounded by windows. It is neat and well organised. There is cooling and heating in every room (plus fans), and the kitchen is well stocked with pots, pans, and other requirements along with a nice big fridge and freezer.  We found the place had everything we needed for a comfortable long-term stay.\r\n\r\nFor us, the location so close to three big parks (incl. Central Park), Columbia and Harlem, was just right. There are transport options aplenty: bikes up and down Riverside Park, the 1 MTA line two blocks away and frequent Broadway buses.  Paul kindly lent us his two bikes which was a fab way to get around the city. Being located on the border of UWS is great as it is a relatively quiet area to stay but the rest of Manhattan is readily accessible through the 1 line meaning we got the best of Manhattan action combined with good sleeping! Would stay again in a flash!"

I was in NYC for 2 weeks at Columbia and the location was just a few blocks away. I didn't want to deal with transit in the AM, although that would not have been a big issue anyway.  Plus, it's right off broadway (the broadway that has shows) so subways access was great. Since it's a college town, I felt super safe and there were minimal tourists and minimal bums also. A couple things to note: this is actually Paul's residence so there are some personal affects to be mindful of.  I really appreciated that though because I was able to tap into the Tylenol and bandaids in the medicine cabinet over the course of 2 weeks. Hey, anything can happen!  He was totally respectful of my privacy and wasn't popping in or out during my stay.  I'm hopeful that if Teachers college has anymore trainings that I get to go to, Paul's place is available!"

The location is outstanding. Such a lovely upper west side block, across the street and around the corner from Columbia. I was visiting my son who is a student there. Even if Columbia wasn't your destination, Paul's apartment is one block from lovely Riverside Park and the Hudson River. Morningside park is a few blocks to the east. Central Park North and Cathedral Parkway are 5-10 minutes away. The 1 train stops 2-4 blocks away. The UWS is very gracious. The pace is less frenetic which is a nice thing at the end of a day of NYC touring. Yet the nearness of Columbia gives the neighborhood a youthful hip vibe. And Columbia's campus is outstanding; lovely and compact. I felt safe coming and going from Paul's building. The building was well maintained. The hallway outside his door wasn't dark and depressing. There is a laundry in the basement and a garbage chute in the hall on his floor. Paul's apartment is decorated with an artist's eye; the furniture, art, even the plates and skillets, were beautiful, colorful, special. The kitchen/sitting room was filled with light! Everything was in its place. My bedroom had a very big, comfortable bed. The bed linens were soft; the colors were muted and restful. There was plenty of drawer and closet space. The table lighting was exceptional. I had a lovely view of a church and Columbia outside my bedroom window. Paul was so kind to welcome me very early due to my 5a arrival into JFK on a red eye from SF. He was quickly responsive when I requested my stay. He met me and welcomed me into his home. He made me tea, fruit and nuts. He gave me plenty of towels and wash clothes. He gave me a shelf in the bathroom for my toiletries. I unpacked, showered (plenty of hot water), and headed out to my first meeting. Paul was lovely to talk to, yet respectful of my privacy. He welcomed both of my young adult children into his home. My daughter (who is graduating from NYU) cooked 2 breakfasts in Paul's kitchen. She so enjoyed his window seat in his kitchen. My son lingered and did schoolwork at the kitchen table. Paul's space was so much more gracious than a dorm room! Paul even printed out my boarding pass when I was out and about. He also printed 36 pages of work that I had completed while spending the day in the libraries at Columbia and the cafes near Columbia while my son wrote a paper. Making that personal connection with Paul enhanced my stay. But he was so quiet and gracious that guests who want to keep to themselves would also be comfortable. My son has 3 more years at Columbia and..."

You are at the doorstep of Colombia as well as on a short walking distance to St John the Divine and Central Park. The 1-line (subway) is literally around the corner so Midtown is very easy to reach. The apt is quiet and I slept really well. Paul knows the area very well and was very generous not only sharing his apt but also his inside tips & tricks about the area. Paul is a genuine person who does whatever he can to make your stay as comfortable as possible."

And yet unobtrusive \u2014 never had to compete for the bathroom (I was worried about the shared bath beforehand), and I always felt like we had complete privacy when we needed it.\n\nLocation cannot be beat; just two minutes to Barnard and Columbia and the subway.  Easy to hop on subway to get to Broadway shows too.\n\nParking was free and fairly easy, and I was always able to park within a block or two. I only had to move my car once to avoid street cleaning.\n\nOn 8th floor so quiet and bed is a comfy; we slept like babies.  \n\nWe enjoyed Paul and his home so much we feel like we have a family member in the city and plan to be back!"

El piso est\u00e1 en una playa tipo surfista, en primera l\u00ednea y delante tiene la l\u00ednea del autob\u00fas que te lleva al centro de Oporto bordeando el mar y el r\u00edo. Tambi\u00e9n a unos cuantos metros puedes coger el metro que te deja en la parte alta del centro de Oporto pero es bastante ruidoso.\r\nEl piso est\u00e1 muy bien para los que quieren combinar playa con ambiente de la ciudad de Oporto.\r\nNosotros \u00edbamos en familia con ni\u00f1os (12-14) y nos encaj\u00f3 bien. Pasamos un par de d\u00edas en Oporto (pateada, paseo en barco, funicular, telesf\u00e9rico, tranv\u00eda...) y otros dos en Matoshinos y en Leca da Palmeira (surf, piscinas de mar, ba\u00f1os...). El agua del mar fr\u00eda, conviene neopreno.\r\nBueno, que hemos pasado unos d\u00edas estupendos y entretenidos.\r\nFelicidades a los portugueses por hablar ingl\u00e9s y m\u00e1s o menos espa\u00f1ol y hacerse entender.

When I were leaving, they noticed that I got two pieces of  heavy luggage. They helped me take it to the bus station and saw me off. As a first-time traveler to Hong Kong and a Main-lander, I thank Crystal and her husband for offering me such a pleasant experience."

Her and her husband greeted us with smiles and showed us around their place. They thought of everything for their guests - including a power adapter! In addition to their bathroom and kitchen, we enjoyed the extra amenities their place provided like the work out facility and yoga room. Hopefully we will be back when it is warmer to use the pool! Great location in walking distance to many shops and restaurants - fun area of Hong Kong. Thanks again Crystal!"

Even prepared card holder of various member cards for our use since they know we wouldn't have. They also provide us some useful tips and very responsive in text and able to give us the help we need. Thankful for that. \r\n\r\nReally good location to stay in and MTR is just 5mins walk away which is just a straight route. We can start shopping once we get out of the building. It's a waste we didn't had time to use the facilities.\r\n\r\nThe only con part would be the room is really small. It only allow us to open one big luggage (29' inch) at a time. But the room itself is pretty cozy and clean! :) \r\n\r\nOverall it's a good stay, wouldn't mind booking their place when I visit HK again!"

Room could be a little bigger but by Hong Kong standards I guess it is standard size. Also location was great as it was close to the MTR and lots of shopping and eating. We highly recommend this room for anyone visiting Hong Kong."

Also crystal had informed us that she wont be around during a certain time a few days earlier but we'd left for macau/hong kong just a day before she sent us a email, which made things worse, as none of us had bought the local sim card and i didnt check my email. And since we didnt know which flat she was stayign in, we couldnt even tell the guards there, for them to allow us go up. when we asked the guard if there was wifi at the lobby, sadly there was none so we couldnt get into airbnb. so we had to get the local sim card and connect to the internet so i could check my email. thank god her husband mike, left his contact number and flat number via email. basically the timing was so wrong. cant entirely blame it on crystal.  otherwise everything was good. the space was a bit small, location is walking distance from Mongkok East station. So that was really good for moving around. Hardly got to meet crystal but her husband mike was always around  in the evenings. so, he gave us quite a tip to take a cab to go to the airport rather than taking the MTR especially if you have luggage. \r\n\r\nmain tip: take the train to mongkok east, and check your email/airbnb a day before and on the day of arrival in hong kong for updates your host has left for you.

The place has a gym and a pool and feels like a 5 star hotel. The room and bed are small but this is too be expected in Hong Kong and it's more than enough. The hosts were lovely and really got us out of a pickle with speedy replies and instant book even though it was late."

I stayed for 10 nights with the majority of my time out, and tippy toeing back in anywhere between midnight and 5am! The room itself is small, but very typical of Hong Kong with air con (a must in humidity of 80%). \r\nThe block in which the tower is in is clearly very well looked after and very classy - it even has a gym and swimming pool on the 5th floor which I used once. \r\nWhen I stayed they had a newborn baby, which I have to say didn't have the lungs or the crying capacity to make any noise whatsoever. It was more silent than me. \r\n\r\nI didn't make much use of the flat as a whole, but stayed mostly in my room. Have to say, I really liked the husband as did my friend. Really decent guy - just hospitable and someone you can see yourself going out with. Top people and exactly what this website is about. "

Moreover, the outdoor swimming pool is fantastic!  And our host is really a lovely couple. The only shortcoming is that the room is a little bit small. But that's Hong Kong, so we feel it acceptable."

The room itself is small but cozy, with quality furniture and ergonomic bedding. For single travelers, this is an easy choice; less so for couples (due to space). Do note, however, that since there is an infant, washing machine is not available for guests to use."

They allowed us to leave our luggage before check-in time and after check-out time which was great as we didn't need to carry our bags during the last day before going to the airport. Also, the house looks perfectly the same as it looks in the pictures. The room is small but enough for one-two nights in Hong Kong. The most important thing is that everything was clean and we rest 100% in the room provided. The only thing we are disappointed with is that we couldn't have a chat with them and it could have been a great help for our visit in Hong Kong giving us some tips about the city. That's how Airbnb works, experience in a local house to share a small chat or even a coffee but it wasn't nothing like that. Anyway, in general, we are happy with our stayed."

It is a newly developed condo located at one of the prime locations of the city, with access to all amenities you can imagine. Besides, I am particularly impressed with the lobby and property management service. \n\n\nThe room is not big, but quiet and comfortable. And Lung is an amazing host who's always there to offer help and advice.  \n\n\nI would definitely choose Lung's apartment again. My rating is \"strongly recommend\". "

Kitchen and bathroom are also clean and nice. The location of the apartment is great with 5 minute walk to 2 MTR stations and some markets in the neighborhood."

It is a fairly new building with an impressive entrance reception hall. It is safe as there are receptionists there at all hours, and with security pass needed to get through to the elevtors. Room is fairly compact but is adequate.\r\n\r\nYou can literally find whatever you need in the area with hundreds of restaurants, foodstalls, clothing , shoes, electronics and inexpensive goodies along the streets.

It's very close to lots of restaurants especially if you enjoy local street food.  It's safe as there's 24/7 security in the building.  Last but not least, the hosts (Both Mike and Crystal) are super nice and friendly.\n\nYes, the room is quite small but it's common in HK.  It should be sufficient for 1-2 people."

He was very friendly at house, and we had the chance to spend time together outside. Staying with him reflects the true meaning of this website, which is living as a local with a local person. Thank you Nihat. \nRegarding the apartment, it is exactly as described. The room is nice and bed is comfortable. It was clean and well prepared for us. \nRegarding the neighborhood, it is very close to Taksim square and Istiklal Street with few minutes walk. As normal as it is in Istanbul, there is a short hill you need to walk to get to the square, which was totally fine with us. \n\nIn general, next time I visit Istanbul I would first check the availability with Nihat before searching others."

Ela inclusive deixou \u00e1gua e cervejas gelada na geladeira, camas arrumadas, toalhas no banheiro, novos sabonetes e at\u00e9 alguns rem\u00e9dios em caso de emerg\u00eancia. Tamb\u00e9m se ofereceu  para ajudar v\u00e1rias vezes e se mostrou 100% a disposi\u00e7\u00e3o. \r\n\r\nO apto \u00e9 perfeito: amplo, arejado, muiiiito bem localizado. H\u00e1 1 quadra da praia, rodeado de bares, bons restaurantes, lanchonetes, healthy foods, hamburguerias, temakerias etc. Garantia de economia de tempo de deslocamentos, porque d\u00e1 para fazer tudo a p\u00e9."
